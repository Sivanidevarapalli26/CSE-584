itll really wipe the floor with it but you could prob just swap out the g3 for either a fde or tnf for like 30 more dollars.  The only reason to get the white is to make it more noticeable in the dark/less white in the
He could tell that the camera man was recording and yet he still went through with the stunt anyway.
But he still didnt eat.
It so happened that I did not take a picture. I do, however, have a digital copy if anyone is interested.   The image quality is pretty crappy.
Albus and Aberforth Theorem

The picture was dusty. The person was dead. There was no more dirt in the picture.
But surely people realize, that while some religions may be bad...most do not involve kidnapping children or beating people to death for not following them.
For ten min utes    I saw it
And whenI left he was crying and scared because he felt all alone with out me, and that's when I realized how much I've hurt him because I never gave him space.
I had no idea people actually had such a strong dislike for the show that they could be openly proud of being unable to tolerate it. That's insane.
If Snape had been alive and the Death Eater's were all dead, he'd be able to teach her, maybe.
The silence pressed upon me like a drum. I looked about, to try to understand where I was, but to my surprise, I saw a door. It was the only one in the room, the only door I could see—and there was light, too,
Cant tell yeh that but she's hot.
Harry walked more quickly. He made a quick turn at the end of the lane, trying to catch up to the students behind him.
The Slytherin colors of my flair made me want to write my flair and now I'm so happy. Thanks /u/Dirty-pink, and thanks for the giveaway :D
Which leaves you and your partner with almost no options to get home. It is a common enough problem with single parents, who have to worry about finding safe parking in the evening to take their child to a day care or school, but in this case you could be stuck
Albus was heartbroken His daughter was taken away. He is unable to go on without her.
Yehd die of hunger and thirst
Harry and the Weasleys, where a new wizard has to decide whether they should be with him or his sister.  I had read every book but hated every single one of them.  It took me years to finally stop hating them, and now I consider them classics.
That evening Dudley paraded his team to the stadium to watch the Liverpool game and saw the Anfield Kop explode with his former teammates.
Yes boy your parents are definitely trying to help. What's your main issue? If you don't mind, I'd like to look into your situation to see if there is anything I can suggest or if there's anything your parents could have done better.   As

About twenty ghosts had been discovered in a cemetery the previous evening, so when a mysterious, ghostly figure appeared in front of him in the cemetery, it was quite a shock. "Oh my God! Oh my God!" he exclaimed, looking at his hands. "
The presence of the word "literally" in any sentence. Literally. It's not literal.
They had agreed that you were not allowed to say what is actually in the book and therefore they got rid of it in the final version.  Personally, I prefer having that choice back.  But that's not really what is being asked for here.
One simply uses the search function to find the answer to their question.  The only problem with that is, that it doesn't really make sense on this sub, where the top-level comments are usually full of people talking about whatever they can think of.  So
It doesnt just turn on and off. It can be set in a state called "no keyboard", where every command sent is completely unresponsive or a single command that can be done with another keyboard (with no modifiers key pressed) also does not work. And all keys

He spoke with a group of reporters who were watching the event, saying his campaign's strategy will be to stay focused on the core message of his first campaign – his promise to "drain the swamp" of Washington.

But you said it's a game changer. So your conclusion is you think it's a game changer.

Hagrid leaned across the desk to Harry as the two stood facing one another. “I believe you are going to like it here. It’s full of people that want you to succeed.” Harry frowned, taking the statement in. “And for
Both Harry and Ron are wizards. It makes perfect sense, why would they let a commoner play in the game of thrones.
They flitted along corridors and hallways, avoiding their adversaries to get to the other side of the chamber.
Harry then did something I didn’t think he would do: He asked him to stay for dinner to which the man said “I cannot”. The guest then offered to pay his bill, and Harry declined.  It’s hard to be
The Quidditch season had some of the best moments for me.  The first game and the last game being my favourites.

Slowly she looked up to see a beautiful sight
They found Hermione downstairs in the library. It's now obvious that Voldemort is behind all the recent attacks. Voldemort is taking out all the children who oppose his dark plan.
There she said pointing it at the camera, that's why the water is still.
Gloom seemed to be pretty good about getting to the point in episode 8, but not getting to the very end.
So proud so proud! Congrats to her! She has shown up on the show at her own doing and deserves a standing ovation.
The dog must be really good then. I have a golden retriever/lab mix who’s never been away from me for more than a week and she’s not always the best at it.
Harry youd better take a good long look in the mirror and ask yourself why you took a picture like this.   Look who you've become.
ARE YOU A WITCH?
One of us has to make a new post
The goblins started to follow the girl and the man. When they were close enough, the goblins came up with a plan. They jumped out of the bushes.  "Hello, my little princess!" said the man.  "You seem to be doing fine here.
Runcorn let me out of prison! I've been held up in there for seven years! How could they do this?!
There was no authorship on the book, this is just a translation/translation. If you really want to believe in the author, read the book "Kimi ga Shitai Desu," where it is actually written (all the characters and language). The author has

Yes said Hermione I said yes, to the very thing she had to do
Youve done really well for the past four days!
She turned and shouted: "How dare you, you vile and revolting man, to talk to me as if I'm a piece of meat?"
Harry threw him a ball and Ron hit his foot. He was hurt and I think it's safe to say the rest of the book is a bunch of lies and misquotes.
Harry noticed that she looked a lot less stressed.
You said YouKnowWhos name out loud?  We're going to hell.
He crept out of his room in a very fast fashion, and ran down the stairs to make sure all the doors were locked.

Then we got to the bit about "if I don't say x, then they can't prove I didn't say x"  It's all about the mind games. You have to find a way to trick them into making an error.

Around him brooms were being swept away while the man was walking the ground.
Good well look Neville!
Youd better take otheo seriously because hes going to get a huge contract soon. If he falls off then the bears will cut him. He might not get another good contract before the draft.
Ariana was barely seven years old when she was diagnosed with a rare disease, and it has been quite a while since her father, Dr. William L. Anderson, has spoken about it.

Harry stepped out of the shadows at the first of an hour-long trip to the palace.
Hermione and Neville were friends in seventh, eighth and ninth...

The cut had turned out pretty well but now I need to find a new artist because she didn't use a scalpel and I'm gonna hurt myself.

Well Isay your father would be mad, he has a big family too.

Then a small voice from the darkness said:  "you will never find what you are looking for. Stop. No. Stop. You are doomed."   The Darkness was right, it was only a matter of time until they discovered the location.
He was curled up and trying to eat his face. He was pretty good in a pinch I guess.

Harry quickly looked down at her and grinned.
Three minutes to go. Why does it look like the camera guy is standing in front of the car? Is it just his angle or something?
He tried not to show himself as a total asshole. It's like a girl not being an asshole by not looking at her boyfriend kissing other girls.
I saw the obituary on the front page and almost fell over in my chair. You had better be very, very proud of her, OP!
Harrys was owned by the man, this should be no suprise.
Always use the proper form for this. When I was training, the instructor would call out every single time you missed, every time you went too low or too high and then if you did it again, you would get a red card. It was a good way to
The Wedding I like the most was the wedding in S2E10 of South Park: The Stick of Truth. I loved all of the jokes, the acting, and the fact that they got to do all this with no commercials.

He stroked the door. "I think so, I know I'm going to love that guy."

All right said Hermione.  "Good morning, Professor.  Have a good one."  She was about to leave the room when Harry appeared, his lips curling up in what looked like a sneer.  "I thought you hadn't arrived yet, Professor
Hagrid was drinking deeply of a tall, dark, and dank scotch he had bought from some drunk merchant.  As he downed the scotch, he lifted the glass, and poured it out, then set it on the table between himself and the fire
After a meal of bacon and eggs, it takes a bit to feel normal
We know that said one in the comics was the first human to make it out of the prison and was then turned into a cyborg. We know they can be made human again, and probably will be, because they were turned in an accident or during a revolution,

At last Norbert was able to feel that he was on the right track. He was in control of his life again, not just his actions but also his thoughts.
Ive thought of writing something similar in the past. Im glad someone did!

Hermione however looked puzzled. It had a funny little light in her eyes she said, "Well, I don't know. Why do you ask?"

Some of em came in the box and I had to put them in a bag to take them back outside.
Please cheer up Hagrid. That is so incredibly unfair. It's not like you had any power over her. You didn't even want to have sex with her.   What will her future be like? How will she deal with all the other problems you caused her
But Dumbledore like MadEye would be one of the most fun and interesting villains ever. There is no way the writers would ever do him justice.
Harry left the locker room without his headgear
Youre worth twelve of him
The troll swayed on a beam of light. It flailed its arms, twisting and turning in a flurry of red light. Its face was red, so were its limbs and torso. Its skin had the same dull, dull appearance it had a hundred times over. It

They were spending many nights and weekends in a row together.
Id like to appeal to you to use the search function, I see several "exactly the same" posts like yours.    I don't have anything against the new system, it's just the same old posts over and over.
You come back after they leave to check on them.
Couldnt you do something like this in like 4 hours?
He had clearly gotten out of the way. This is not a common occurrence.  He could easily have been hit by a car. People are very fucking stupid.
You only agreed to that if you knew you were going to get that much. If I was your manager and you said that it would be a bonus based on your previous work, would you still accept that deal?

Regulus was trying to show his sister how far he can stretch his wings and what he can do with them. He told her that she should be careful and she should stay in the safety of her own castle.
And now before we forget, here's another look at the two upcoming episodes of Supergirl's fifth season. It's one of those "who cares" kind of things. But it's also a "let's be careful what we wish for" kind of thing,
Now wait jus one moment
Then Death stood aside and said to himself: “This man is wise.” Then he said, “Who gave me authority to kill?”
She leaned forward over the edge of the couch, and I leaned my head back against the wall behind her.
Its people they feel need to be "respected". Not that hard to find.
When they knocked on the door I said "let's go". It's good to be alone. I was just thinking about going to get a hot dog or something. Not going to do anything.
Harry looked up and saw his father, sitting at his window in the front of the house. His head lowered, and Harry watched his father go into his study. Harry stood for a moment, thinking. He walked back to the tree-filled yard. He saw two

And he was gliding out of there without the airspeed indicator. How did he manage to drift so far over the limit and still have it go straight up?   Also that’s a very low altitude for it to be able to glide that way.
Harry watched Hagridgetting redder and redderand redder and redder and redder and redder, until his eyes started to water. But finally he gave in. Hagrid went out of the room, and Harry went out of the room, too.
Itwas also very hard for me to find the right ones. Just looking for some good cheap games that would be fun to play with my son. I know you are supposed to get a free game, so just letting you know that is just not my experience.
So he pelts Dumbledore with a piece of wood.  Then he has to find a way to kill everyone who's ever loved Harry.  Because you know that doesn't end well.
He strode up and down the hallway, checking all the rooms he had yet to visit.
But before he went home, I felt a twinge in the back of my throat, I thought I could almost feel my heart stop beating. I was beginning to wonder what this was all about. All that I could see was this man's hand in my hair.
Neville went bright red for the start of this one.
If he had only been on the team before the injury he would probably be a top 10 QB.

The timing was siginificant. This could have had a big impact on the campaign. We are going to have to be ready next cycle.
Albus Dumbledore didnt seem to notice.
Here too snow lay down in the city. I was too lazy and lazy to get dressed and to my job, so I took to the hills and mountains. My office was a nice view over the mountains. But I didn't have to see them in the dark...
Deaths got an Invisibility cloak.   It doesn't stop me from looking.   I also know what happens when I touch the wall.

You mother confessed sneered at my confession and told me I'd never make it, so I made a pact with myself, that for every confession I got I'd make it until I was dead. Then my mom told me that she knew I was lying.
Ron responded by maintaining the same tone, a self-deprecating humor that made me smile.

Dudley did not answer the phone at her home.
The owl then fluttered away over a bridge, as if she had already moved on to other things.
Not for nothing though, but that's a pretty funny way of phrasing it.  If you're going to use that logic, why not call a car a "person" when it has arms and legs and other parts?
Weve had a couple friends who have worked in the past go to one in the past and have had a good time. I think it depends on what your looking for. If you want to socialize its a good option, if youre looking for more of an experience

When Harry knocked they all went inside to eat and Harry got a little bored while he was alone, looking at the tablecloth. Suddenly he saw it. He could not believe his eyes as his eyes swept the room. No, it was not a painting. No,
Struggling to draw breath, we get a glimpse of the human suffering, and see that it leads to greater suffering. And this is what the series tries to do in the first episode, and succeeds. The characters face real hardships, and even though they eventually win and get

Its weird isnt it. Even though I'm aware that it's a fucking joke the fact that it's on the cover of the game really hurts its impact. It's like the movie "The Matrix" and it's "the part where everyone is wearing yellow."
Whereve you put the code for the game? In the steam folder where you downloaded the game? And it's not like it automatically saves all the data for you, you have to choose it and save it

A plump woman outside of a bar in a hotel in Florida is arrested and accused of using a sex toy to try to kill herself.
Dumbledore was sure Riddle was after Harry, but he wasn't going to tell him about it, just in case. So, he did say that he had "his own business going on".

Harry became aware of the change after being told about it by the Ministry, when he heard of it from William in a letter, a few days later.
The dark corridor behind his eyes was the most telling thing to me. He doesn't feel like he belongs, and is probably scared of his own shadow.
All the old kids were still there, with me and the two girls, and the boy was just there...

and the thing that keeps it balanced is the amount of ammo it can hold.  this makes it a great tank for tank battles.
Harry whirled around slipping on an icy patch, his feet slipping from under him.
You know the only reason I've ever found myself in a situation where I need to punch someone was because of a video of someone punching someone else, and then the person who punched them punched the person who punched them.   And I'm not a violent person at

The way Bathilda told it was that after getting off the elevator, there was a group of other girls waiting to go up and she was being forced to go with them. So the other girls held her hands down while they got in line.
We wondered said Hermione, as she looked about her.
Very safe as theyre used to being hit in the face for hours a day
Never mind what theyre gonna do. Im just here wanting to hear what theyre gonna do
Only if you were on PC
Hagrid swerved but the spell didn't hit him. If he turned around he'd be trapped under the rubble. If he stood still he'd die.
Hagrid was sitting in a chair in the dark when he noticed that the door to the room was open.
That was Siriuss brother...he posted a reply on twitter about the issue and was told he was banned on the site. He is using the same IP
What world Hagrid looked like.
Lupin and Bill said the episode has to go well with the first one, and that they could go either way. That means they could make them all the same.

Students are finishingthe feast and dancing around the table!
And Neville will play a role in the new movie. He will take a more neutral role than he did in the books.
Ron had had a lot of help on the house.
Yes and zat eez o'clock
Theres nothin that lives that long in the ground. Even a plant in a pot will go away in a few days.
We cant wait for that one day when we go through the same shit, to have a great "I told you so." conversation.
He turned around and ran back towards me.
Alas who knows said god. I would like to say he is, but I’m not sure.
Ev eryone exclaimed over the  fact that  I  was  so  sexy  - my pussy and my breasts looked so fucking great!!!
Chapter Certainly I knew not, at that time, how it should come to pass that one day the earth should be covered with the glory of the Lord, and that there should be no more mountains, or hills, or valleys; but that all these things should be covered
Hermiones sulkiness could not have been more perfect.
How did he get the top hat out of that other car?

Hermione took out a sheet of parchment and stuck it in Ron's hand.
Engraved in foothigh letters: **SOLVED**
So where are these people now that are going to be able to afford these homes?  How many of these people will be able to afford the mortgage/rent combined of these houses and do they have the savings to pay all of that off?
He marched out of his house the other day with a small black dog, and a stick. They weren't dogs, but he wanted to show his pride for the animals in the area, which weren't as lucky as his family. And he wanted to show all his
They had almost given up. We were on the verge of losing our last chance to see the sun set over the Hudson River at one of our favorite places. But a chance to see an incredible solar eclipse was about to come our way. We had just enough time to
there are loads of other people who do the same thing so I would be reluctant to call it a "problem"  also if there are other people who don't care then how is it a problem for you and me?  edit- this also sounds more like an

The moment it parted me and I saw how beautiful it was.
It washolding a huge amount of weight! It's like someone was holding a giant sack of water under a desk.  The poor girl was struggling to get free.
He felt angry and hurt about it at first but then realized that I wasn't as bad as she makes me sound.
They turned to go, and the second one shot him with a machinegun.
Mastering himself again he says.  Well, I'll let you know.
Good luck everyone shouted me down when I posted this because I knew that there are still a lot of people who believe this. I'm sorry if this gets buried by all the people who want to continue to believe this crap.

First time at Hogwarts on Christmas day.
A hooded figure came out of the darkness of the forest into the light of the streetlights and looked at the two people in their midst.
One pair of protective glasses or goggles is all I use. But with a full face helmet or glasses and a visor it makes you look like you're the coolest dude in the world.
I He was glad to be able to help.
Here I go nowdont be a douche and I’m gonna get it done at one sitting and then post the pic.
Then suddenly Hagrid let out a yelp as if his mouth were full.
Declaring himself might have been a good idea, then...  This guy is not a good friend. He is very close to losing his friend, but he's going to make sure not to go too far...  It sucks, but you need to decide whether you want
They werent in a relationship tho
To their great surprise, the majority of those interviewed were not concerned, if anything, that the use of mobile phones may have negative impacts on public health
Hagrid kicked the motorbike, sending the car spinning out of control.  I looked at my watch, it was time for class.
Why did the young man want to live his life without having to wear a hat?
He felt like asking out his friends but not them.   When he gets home he'll be like: *"Oh god, where do I begin?"*
Holding it up in the air.  Also, "caught in a web"
At last Hermione tapped into her own magical powers. She was able to teleport, which is more than most people could do, but she didn’t realize that the spell she was able to cast had such great drawbacks.
We should have gotten an hour long film about the people who lived in this town prior to the war.
Unfortunately said Scrimgeour that they've been having a little technical problems (they also said to expect a few patches), but that the game will continue to improve, and get more people out.
just take it and stop
Hermione slipped out of Harry's arms and grabbed her wand.
There was suddenly a flurry of activity in the kitchen today: a pot of boiling water, the steam of steaming soup, the cracking of pots. It was lunchtime and the family had returned from the bus stop. It was a time of quiet and reflection: a

Harry though he recognized me right off the bat. My name's Alastair.
Professor McGonagall stopped outside the room to make sure the boy's eyes wouldn't be open again.  A sly grin came to the teacher's face as she saw him, but it disappeared quickly as his eyes began to furl.  McGonagall was relieved when a
Thats chess snapped Ron. Chess. Chess.
She took another large bite of fruit, then opened her mouth to pull out some more food.  The only person she could see in that house was her, the other people were all in the dark.  And she was alone.  She couldn't be afraid,
Indeed as Phineas Nigellus Pizzericus, your actions in life, especially your actions on Reddit will not go unpunished!
Ron yelled in shock as we were looking at some of the older stuff with him.
He was in the house with you during the party and he said he didn't remember? Not to say he's lying, but he must be lying, because if that's the case then I can't see how he can be trusted.
Why Harry swallowed now. That's not going to help.
Well give him here. We need more people who would want to help the community.
A blue light had been installed to warn people that there was a fire at the facility. A team of volunteers made their way down to the water tank and put the fire out, but they didn't realize that there was an inferno underneath.
Well I got back from the ER today and my knee is swollen as fuuuuuuck. Dr prescribed no more than 2 days off of the running stuff with this bad boy. Still hurts to walk on. Hoping to get in some bike runs in the coming
It seemed a lifetime ago, when the Soviet Union launched a massive offensive across the Soviet Baltic republics in October 1991, that these territories might be able to form an effective defense against what was then an unstoppable foe. Instead, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia have been a lost
Gellert Your point about having to explain is the same as my point about the point you wanted to make. I don't understand why it matters to you what the point I want to make is. You are clearly angry and I don't like that. We will not discuss
This isnt magic its just magic.      EDIT: this is why you should be on the r/drama sub instead of /r/adviceanimals
I know what youre talking about. In one match (it happened to me when using sledgehammer), my game didnt even load in. I died in the spawn, and my character was running around the game for 15 seconds before it loaded in, then it told me
You who have never been to a gun range, where you are seated at the table waiting for someone with a weapon to walk around the room shooting his own gun - that is the real world equivalent of an airport runway.  Guns, whether you have a permit or not
Ive been thinking about picking up an XS max, what case is that?
Itll be like a reverse of Bf1, youll get more exp but also be more likely to get demotivated when theres no more to be got.   I feel like itll be a bit like getting a trophy, a badge on your gamer
The common room was a nice setting, a nice area to have your feet up and your chin resting against the arm of the couch as you listened to music.
Dumbledore cannot come here, but this wizard will.
Harry look She was a sexy slut
What would I get instead of the regular?
Now that Dumbledore is dead, it would be a nice twist if the new headmaster was actually Remus Lupin...

Dream he said sitting up straight at dinner.
Some had no title or were from some other country. The title was just a tag line that could go in the title.  There were titles from people who just wanted a title to go in their blog post title.
Well Fred and George had some kind of "buddy cop" relationship in the earlier episodes when George was still learning to drive, but in a movie. Fred and George have also done things as partners but usually not in a movie.
Harry spotted Professor Quirtell. "You looking for something?"
LIAR Harry shouted suddenly.Quirrell raised his hand to make a signal to Voldemort to stop.
Until they were hens.
He handed Harry a note that read, "Harry, you are the best man I have ever had. I am the luckiest father in the world."
Harry hurried o up stairs so he could meet the man of his dreams
Her face had a strange look on it.

As seven oclock drew near the first group of boys arrived on the platform and the first passenger arrived just before 8:00 a.m. I decided to ride the bus. It was good to see the sun shining and to experience the beauty of the city of Sao Paulo
Im sure this is just one of the thousands of pictures that come into this subreddit daily.
This was in contrast to my recent experience where I took some of the lowest doses of any MDMA I've taken. But, on a related note, did you notice your experience with MDMA varies depending on what type of roll you do?
Hold tight she whispered. Don’t let go, don’t let her go... She was the light, the light was her.

I just did a 5 second double take and a quick glance in the mirror and saw one black girl and one white girl in each picture.
He had trusted Dumbledore and the Order.
He understood what he was saying so it's understandable.
Hagrid you live in a mud hut and you still want to live out of a backpackers house. Harry doesn't have a problem with it just because of the weirdness of it, it's his own lifestyle.
Look at this said in an Australian accent:  *I am a little boy! I am a little boy! I am a little boy! I am a little boy!*
He made Kreacher drink?  That's some deep shit
Brilliant said Harry clapping would "give the people a sense that they had a stake in politics, had something to do and that the government was listening to them."  But the government is still listening to the rich.
As we knew he would be, they just made it so she could never be president.
While Mrs. Dursley was busy studying at the library, Mrs. Weasley prepared food for the family that would be waiting for her. In the morning, she would take them to the train station. It was important that they be together as a family, and Ginny had decided it
Do we er have to be a part of the eu to be in this?
What had Hagrid said?
It came as an overcast Friday morning and was overcast at all times for most of the day.
He was angry that you didn't get a promotion, but it had nothing to do with the fact that he was your boss and you were his employee.
Hed done it hed done it
Hagrid pulled out the book
Why didnt Ron and Darryl kill themselves at the same time, so they could all be there for it?
She took a deep breath and opened the door to the reception room. She looked around with a bit of panic and a bit of excitement in her eyes.
Cold damp air rushed up our noses, filled our lungs, and took control of our minds.
Snape the sleeping snake!
Do you feel allall your money and the debt you took on is what lead you to this point in life? Have you worked your ass off to pay it back? I know it sounds like a rant but it is probably the only way to fix your attitude and your actions
If only he knew that he was fighting the wrong people. I wouldn't even be surprised if they were behind some of the murders that occurred in the town that night.
He was turning the ball over, yes, but he was also creating space to throw it to the open man. I think if he made that play, it would have been a huge moment. He also played a great shot to make that free throw.
Im glad they did. We need to be able to change our load outs for each game type and I think this would be a great way for that to happen.  That being said, I think it would be even better for them if we were able to trade load outs
it looks like Dumbledore is holding a wand and Harry is standing beside him while the book has been written by Hagrid.
Look said Harry throwing a balled up wad at him. This was the very next shot.  > "My dear, what were you thinking, hurling something at my ear?"  >"It was a ball," said Harry.  >"Yes?"
When they say every two months, does that mean a 2.5-year window or a 2-year time period? I'm guessing it's a time period, but there's no way this ends by 2.5 years.  Not to mention that it's
Its one oclock in the morning, and I've already played all my games for the week.   Guess I'll be playing WoW all night then!
Can you conde in on a few of them too please
You cant blame them for leaving their home country where they were able to learn their craft. I think if they were able to make good in America then they should try.   Also I dont get the hate for this guy. I'm not a big fan of him
Whys Bane so angry in the movie?
Always good value. My first time ordering they sent me 2 packs of 4. I didn't get a warning before this and I got charged about half of it. I got my packs and it's all really good, just a little low on the strength
They glanced back repeatedly at it, then kept walking, and then went back to it again. They didn't see it until after they'd already left the premises and started running.
Oh are you doing this because of the price drop? I'm probably gonna do the same once they're done with the xboxone.
Meanwhile he was at the World Cup with a busted ACL
He couldnt stay here though. He didnt work out.
Nah that storys just an excuse to show his power
Dudleys favorite punching bag will never be on the show any more.
And youve got dirt on your balls.   That looks nasty.
Chapter The Wedding Three : The Bride and the Bridegroom
She broke my eye socket and my brain by throwing herself at me in a bar once. It was one of those situations where I'm not entirely sure how she managed to not kill me, she just kept hitting me.
Neville stared at their faces, and they looked back.
One thing wascertain there would be one person in this movie to make it worth watching: Ben Affleck. And the only thing that would be better than him being in this movie would be someone other than Affleck being in it. And then there is George Clooney,
Tonkss changed didnt it?
The Dursleys were cowering in their basements. Harry could see his brother in the mirror, standing in front of him, staring down at a letter.
Harry was not wearing any gloves. That's what you call a bit of negligence.
I still dont really like the black/gold but I think it fits very well on your skin tone and that's something to be really proud of!
Hermione they said together.It's obvious to me it's not because of the sex,but because of the way that they treated each other.They even said they were so in love they couldn't bear to be parted for more than 24hours.What did they do after that
Draco Malfoy looked at the two girls in front of him on the stage, and felt a small pang of worry.
Harry ran the length of the court, looking toward the locker room.
Quite right were operating in a capitalist economy. The whole "free and fair" aspect of our capitalist system is that the government takes the money you make from hard work to help out the people in need.   By taking money from all the people you can help with
I heard something. It sounded like the words "Nigga get a grip" but like from a lady.
Hagrid and Harry madefor each other. The wizarding world was like the most diverse place you would ever imagine. There were animals, dragons, wizards, vampires, demons, witches, fairies, wizards and many more. There was also a place called Hogwarts, a school
Hagrids chest swelled at the front, and he had a strange pain. I tried to keep him with the blanket, but he wouldn't let go. This is a picture of him in that state.
How often hadthey complained about her? Did she get any punishment?
Broken images were racing around in the world. How was he able to take a picture and not lose his phone/camera/whatever it is in an instant? I am so jealous of that man and his skills.
They ate stale cornflakes and watched some movies about fighting.
They had lost everybody by the time i was playing, so they had to run their own servers to get more.  But now the servers are dying too, so we only had 4, and 1 guy was still there in the end.  That was fun :D
Oh I wish theyd put up something like this on T.V. I could probably eat that up all day.
Me said Ron looking at the picture.
Sirius never cared about fans, he was the anti Beatles for us.
Was that the sea serpent from the film, I remember the snake and the fish being very similar in design.  Good luck :)
Oh no said Harry Potter that is an easy book to follow and not that difficult to understand
Uncle Vernon entered the room. "Uncle Vernon, what is this thing?" He sat down.
It grew steadily louder.
Lee Jordan was finding his feet at St. James's Park. The 24-year-old full-back had made his debut with the senior side after joining from Sheffield Wednesday on deadline day last summer and had played in 11 competitive games prior to his injury last month.
Its not poison said the poison.
Dont know why hes trying to compare two games with such different mechanics and design. You could easily add this to any game and it will work.
You two had better not end up hating each other and breaking up.    It's possible.
Never thought youd like the taste of semen
Scurrying around the school library.
They shouldnt have written that on his door though
You were yelling your lungs out with pleasure, but you still had room to feel a little bit pain at the same time? I'm not sure that that's possible. I don't even know how to react to that.
Dudley squeaked and ran at me with a look on her face.
I will take them if they are still available
Find something for breakfast/brunch and you'll be fine. Or if you're really into spicy food, get the chipotle.
He was so devastated when her son left her for his girlfriend that he literally broke down and cried. He then went on to cheat on her multiple times, and finally ended things.   He is probably the most miserable, sad person on the planet.
Dudley snored but Harry was right. He should go through with it, he was a great guy and a great friend. He deserves to be in his own book. I am sad and sad for Harry.
Did I hear someone mention that he didn't like this?
Least loved now by the fans and media:  **David Irving.**
You are not a criminal, you're a victim of circumstance. You are in good company. It's not your fault that you had no other choice.
He looked terrified at first then realized that he was on Reddit

Which is that the best way to do so, with respect to the tax, insurance, and insurance fees paid to the driver, or is there a "correct" way?  Edit: For context, we're talking about the "tipping of the car guy",
Uncle Vernon tapped on the shoulder by a young, nervous girl. Vernon said, "Hello, there! I didn't think I would ever see you again. Good evening!"
He hummed Tiptoe Through the Tulips.

Very strange strangers they have.  The real issue here is that they didn't have any idea that you took their dog out for a walk, much less that you're keeping it.  I find it hard to believe the police haven't had any complaints at this point
Er Yes I think you should do it, I’m not sure about the size of your tank as some tanks you need to buy a filter for and other tanks you don’t.  But it would be worth it for you and the puffer to

Well its just a matter of a few minutes.  If the match is cancelled, you dont have to pay anything.
The golden grille before we found out he was gonna be a thing was glorious.
As he pulled into the parking lot, he couldn't help but think how amazing it was to be out in the sunshine.
On one subject however it is the most interesting that the vast majority of the world’s population has not the slightest idea who the Supreme Court justices are and does not follow the U.S. Supreme Court in any way at all. Even among Catholics only about half
But what made him become a great man?
She must be alive.
The rest of them think that because it's been done once it's a bad idea to do it again. They get really mad when anyone suggests that the current system should be changed.
He kept swallowing his drink, it is not like it is a big shot. If you have to do something to show you are awake I think it's the correct way to do it.
Dudley said Harry for the first time on April 20, 2016, "Harry is so happy to be back and home. We are glad he is back with his family and with us. He is as active and loving as he always has been!"

What looked like a "dumb" throwback pass was actually a "stupid" interception by Kwon Alexander that was picked off by Aqib Talib.

As they argued in their appeal, "We are very disappointed, and frankly embarrassed, that the Supreme Court of Canada, in this particular case, agreed to hear the appeal of this case without at least addressing the question of whether Charter rights were actually infringed upon," said
Goodbye Potter And with a nod to you, Goodbye Potter!
Our only chance is a miracle, and he won't get it, because he is a horrible person.
Both of them jumped in to try and help in the beginning, and the guy with the machete in the background got killed.   If I had to choose, I'd have to say the guy with the machete.
Oh shut up said the person who would never actually try to use any sort of logic to argue against anything on the internet ever.
They are rare but I see them in Chicago quite often. There is a black one and a white one, but only black one is rare. Also the black one seems to have less mileage than the white one.
So Voldemort was looking out for him
Ill bet all the money in the world that if I were to buy a new bike right now, the first thing I would do is find a used one. No questions asked. You have so many options and you can customize in your own way.
I just wondered if you got your dog from a breeder that was just a few years old, what kind of a difference does that make?
Peeves cackled.Wandering around at the foot of the castle stairwell, Peeves looked up at the sun shining on the courtyard stone-floored walkway, a good, good old boy.
Were going to have a massive collapse. We've been lucky so far to only be 3-3 in games we could have lost. And this is one of those times. It's our defense that's holding us back.
Ive never asked said people directly. How do you do it?
A single cobweb stretched across the center of the screen, and the only trace of the explosion that had occurred hours earlier, the sound of shattering glass, a splintering noise, and the faintest of groans.
He felt particularly hungry when he got out of the elevator.
Ive been looking for this for so long
And Harry was hurtling towards the sun! So why didn't the explosion occur when the Death Eater shot the Deathly Hallows?
Especially as I can see this just being an excuse to watch all of the previous seasons.   Although I would have expected more than just one season. It would be like watching a season of Lost every time they were off filming.
Ready Harry asked the last man to leave
Blimey Harry after all those years in the Navy, and this man has been around for three of them.  He must have been in the RAF!
Yeah he would said "fuck you bitch"
The snow here had been a surprise! We spent some time getting out for a walk around the neighborhood.
He caught sight of the figure.
Suddenly in a clearing that was otherwise covered by thick cloud
Makes yeh even more depressing to think about how many lives could be saved if the NHS didn't exist.
Hagrid said Dumbledore sounding like the headmaster sounded better than the one he had been. This is because the latter sounded more authoritative/powerful
Thank you smiled Hermione! I think that is your new favourite line haha
Harry felt that nothing really helped him with the pain.
Ive never heard of people doing this. I’ve been doing it for over 15 years

Harry knew that the secret was out and what would happen if he did not tell her.

There had been a lot of hype surrounding this game. It was going to blow up.   Now, it has the opposite of hype.
He sat up and smiled at her.
Hagrid was so huge I almost thought he was a wizard...  I bet he's a hoot to bring to camp
Every night before he fell asleep, I'd tell him that if he ever cheated on me he'd never see his children.
But Hermione raised her hand, pointing at him.
Harry looked at Hermione, and then looked at her with a soft smile.
I killed your father.
Hagrid whats that Butch?
Hestayed at home and watched the office for the first time.  So far I just love it
because it warns Dark Souls players to never trust Dark Souls 3's developers.   If you do, and they fuck you, that's on you for not understanding the "not trust" thing, I guess.
He was quite sure that the last person to die will be him. He was sure of that since it was the only thing that would make sense in the scheme of things. Then the day that he died came. He was in hell, and he felt his soul going

Friday was an important day for me, so I was excited to head out to a lovely restaurant in my hometown to try something new. But when I arrived, I saw that no one had the food and drink available, which led me to ask around. Finally, a
Uncle Vernon stroke to mark 100th birthday
Obviously he thought nobody would watch that and just hoped it would be as easy as he thought.  It took me awhile to figure out what he was doing, but it looks like he thought he could just use a bunch of tasers to quickly disarm his victims.
No oense but you get the idea right?
He also thought he was the best driver in the world, even when he was in his 30s. The dude wanted to race in F1 more than anyone else ever had.
Kreacher said Harry after Voldemort's death to make it more impactful to him.   I don't think any non-magical person would be able to survive in the wizarding world, and for all they knew that wizarding death had already happened when he heard
And so they had their first game without Raul, no?
every odd thing that happens, no matter how insignificant, is some form of an evil plan to bring about total world domination by the end of 2016.
Weve choosing to break them up over the course of this year.   When the time comes to separate us, I have no problem doing it. I know he wont get a good life with them and they wont get a good life together. It would be easier on
To one as young as he is, he is a great man to have on the show, and a great guy.
Most of us reckon we wouldn’t be at the same level without the work done by our predecessors but we have to remember that many of us are pretty ignorant when it comes to science and science education. When we first hear about “the age of rationalism
The smell coming from the machine and the way the machine works are what has always turned me off.  The fact that it is not designed to stop these types of things from happening is very worrisome in this day and age.  I guess that is why this subreddit loves
The muscles in his arms and wrists look like he is playing a drum kit.   I would guess that he uses them as a method to "drag" people towards the "center" when performing this dance.
It didnt so much get more popular as it was more difficult for non-English speakers to find the language setting.  Edit: I just checked and my post was removed due to some technical errors. I'll edit my comment to include the details I left in.
A door opened and a figure appeared out the closed door. The woman who had been in the corner stood up straight as she spoke. She was dressed like a woman from her hair to her shoes to her outfit. "Who are you?" The lady stood in the center

Ron crossed to the side, where his friends were looking out the window. "The thing...the thing is that..." Ron looked at his friends and shrugged as he sat down. "They're a special kind of fucked up, and I just wanted to talk with you
Neither Dumbledore nor Grindelwald died, they just got shot.  Grindelwald wasn't supposed to die until the end of the movies but he did anyways.
This said Wood is an absolute idiot and a waste of a roster spot with how inconsistent he is, and he needs to realize that to take this job seriously it means making the team and being a decent, professional football player on both sides of the ball.  We can
He felt it drag to much and there was too much time to react to the attack with his shield up. I would agree if he kept it up.
Well well well he did say "I will keep working towards it and my own personal goal" so we'll see. He's a liar and a phony and probably a closet trump supporter.
He was glaring at the guy in the chair in front of him. He was not looking at him when the first round started.
Ill get him said!
What Harry feared most of the first lockdown
Or were they all taken in a game of soccer and they've just been waiting to be found ever since?
The cloaked figure reached into her black leather pouch and pulled out the yellowed, folded yellow piece of paper with an image of an olive branch drawn on it.
Slowly Harry walked back from his bed, his room being small and very dark.
See what I mean? This place is full of fucking weirdos
They shrank into the floor of the car.
But here Harrys imagination is very different from OPs. He's a super hero. Also OPs's imagination is very much real and I bet your mum imagines that too.
But instinct overwhelming instinct. If i get hit with a random guy who has full health, i know it's going to end badly.
The chessmen seemed to die in the end
We can just keep giving them free stuff so they keep spending $80 million on their phones.
Surely you have heard the saying,” You’re either going to kill yourself or get killed.” Well it turns out there was a man in Japan who got killed and then was killed again.
The dog was guarding the entrance to their home.
And when youre dressed like that it feels so much better to see your man, that way you can make love to him, not be embarrassed, and not have someone tell you that your clothing is distracting him. Im sure that its a relief to you because it really is
Ron spent evening afternoons on his feet, sometimes working his way around the apartment, some nights out in the garden.
I dreamed a giant octopus ate me while I watched TV.  You know.  Stuff you’d see in that one movie the octopus got stuck in.
Yeh couldve died sobbed. But the guy that was shooting just turned around, put the clip back and got on with life.
But I thought he wasn't allowed to say anything for fear of being sued? He must be so happy to be saying things about the President for this.
Come here Quirrell repeated.  What’s that thing? A wands?
Aguamenti screamed Hermione and he is not a dirty player.
The poor toilets never cleaned properly, never having anything for their shit to rest on. It's so they always had to walk all the way into the water in order to relieve themselves, and even if you did go into the water, it didn't really do anything.
My kind dont usually like the feeling of people looking at them that much. I used to.   If you are walking on the same sidewalk as someone you like, but they are just passing by, be friendly.
Youll be going to the store after you get to school, and youre probably going to be doing some "work" at home.  What's the point in using your personal time for school?  Its a waste of money.    Do you need to
He left me the fuck alone a couple of weeks ago and I thought that was a good sign. But a guy has left me alone every single time this month so I guess I'm not going to get my hopes up. But I'll go out tomorrow to meet a
His Cloak was the first thing i thought of.
Harry sank down next to them, trying to find a comfortable spot.
I never wanted to date anyone. I just wanted to have fun. I think most people feel this way.
We are gathered here to discuss the impact of these new trends on the world of sport and its players.
He dragged blankets omg. He had it all in his pockets. My best friend and I used to say that we would all go to the park naked and we wouldn't do it because it would be so much work.   Well, that was 8 years ago
All last year I said that I wanted a guy who had been in the league 3 years to be my GM if he was available (I'm in a small market) and now I'm sad again, but I still want him to be my GM.   This

This mans name was 'The Black'...
Harry you need your own lawyer to represent your interests, before he loses his temper and does something completely inappropriate.
Cant nothing interfere with a guy wanting a piece. And his friends.
Plenty of courage I am sure.
He looked very pleased with himself when he said 'thank you'
So why have you not been called to do the job?  Because they say you're too poor?  They don't say that to the guys in your area who have better qualifications?  Or are they just not paying enough?  Or are they just saying no
Hermione said clos ing eye would break a boy's heart, but a kiss would heal everything.
Excuse me Professor Flitwick I didn’t see where you said the school was called The Flitwick school of Muggle Studies...
The Horcrux was still active before Harry died. They needed to take it out before going to Albus, otherwise it would kill them.
The bit of Riddle that is left over from last week’s episode is:      If he (Batman) was a dog,      How would he get to sleep at night?      What does a dog
When did you do this? Was it just before or right after the event?
Youre the only one who got a bad score
Well Ill see you guys at the end of the day
She knew the Dumbledores were evil. She knew there was a Dark Lord, but she was still very much a fan of Harry Potter. I doubt she would have killed them if she knew the dark lord was still around

Finally he said in Spanish “Si, yo lo digo, aunque sea inédito”
At half past eight a little red light flashes on the dashboard, giving me a chance to think.
Was it because Dumbledore says that Voldemort was the only person who could save himself in a time like that? I remember that.
The gold ones are called "Spartans" or something similar, I believe.
An then an this post was upvoted?
And what if whatever happened, had the effect of preventing the release of more information, such as about the incident in Cuba?

Hestia Jones gave her final interview Wednesday morning to NBC 5's "Dateline," her first since her father, Walter Williams Jr., was killed by her mother, Angela.
At least hes still alive
All the reasons for this are wrong except it's because he got a tattoo. It's not because he doesn't care about his wife anymore. It's not because he's "a different person". These are just false allegations put out by her to manipulate people. He
yourfather used it mainly in soloqueue, i have no idea why people are mad about that, it was always meant for playing with a group.
He narrowed his wicked eyes and his eyes flared slightly wider as he glanced in the opposite direction of the man who held the gun. "I know you can do better."
Theyll kill us if we keep them locked up like they do now.  What we need is a prison system where the inmates are held in a safe environment and given the best of medical care.   They dont need to be killed. They are already dead on the

But how did they get the car in?
Thats their pretext for wanting to keep us in the EU; if it was because they wanted the US to be out of NATO, then there would be an outcry. The EU doesnt want to be a US ally so they are using "it benefits us" as an argument
I am here as I will also need help.  I am also on xbox
Bathilda shows me a little more of her body than the other girls in the game
Now what were you thinking of buying a dog for?
Hermione how many times have you had sex with my brother?
Are you He is the lord that has given strength to our enemies? He is the one that has been victorious against them, he has made them to stumble. In him we have redemption through his blood, so that through the blood of Jesus Christ, we might be saved
Lupin looked as though he was a bit off it.
His face was set to "holy shit" on that last shot lol. "I can't believe I just did that"
What made you leave?
What appeared to be an explosion occurred at a building in northern Greece early Saturday, with residents of the area seen fleeing in panic.
He did look very promising as a passer. I'd be really interested in his potential development with this club. I've liked him since he came on at the start of the season
Well there you are, I'd rather live with him than anyone. There aren't any problems that would make me not stay.      >He is my friend and I would never intentionally hurt him.  This is what makes this more understandable. No
Who knows where the dog and cat came from, but it is very likely they could have either been born from a bad situation, or were abandoned by their mother who was too ill or too old to take care of them.

However he did let his mom into the house.
The idea that Dumbledore could be using it to cover something or other is rather disturbing; this is a wizard who doesn't believe in the concept of magic at all.   Also, it would suggest that Dumbledore is planning something big; something beyond what Harry knew (such
On Sunday morning Uncle Harry (who had been on hand with Dad for most of the day and had left to be at work at 5:00 a. m.) brought a new batch of cookies for the ladies to enjoy.

Peeves almost fell out of his seat.
Madam Pomfrey mended it?

But according to Beedlejuice, there are no such things as things!
Peeves threw the chalk, so Snape picked it up.

Wheres Luna Excuse me?
As Mr. Chapter Weasley, I feel as though I have failed as the DADA Professor and am truly regretful. Please accept my deepest apologies and forgive me.
No said Harry curtly.
The following week dragged on and on. The final episode of season two still hasn’t aired on Netflix, and even though some have assumed that the series had been canceled, the streaming giant released a teaser trailer for season three. The teaser doesn’t really
Anyway this this wizard stuff is very easy to get into, I just started playing today and am trying to figure out where to get the books.
He was usually the first one to have a laugh in my head, like a good big brother, now he is gone :(
Harry glanced into the mirror, checking his hair and the clothes he was wearing.
Wednesday night found Hermione struggling with some of her problems. Her mother, who’d been worried about her since she’d left the Ministry was back in town and all she could think about was the thought of her mom. She was worried about her grandmother,
Then Mary Mrs. Cattermole gets knocked out during the fall and is brought back in via surgery.
Sirius Sirius was horrible in that fight. It’s amazing that anyone survived.
Hes probably worried about the time he'll waste in front of a live audience.
Harry was going to be a good one for England. It seems like he has a bit more maturity now.
Hermiones hands leapt to the sky with every move,
He mustve know youd see it right away,  he said “oh shit, he saw me on the map!”
These were the books that were on our Christmas tree every year, so we decided to share them with you. These aren’t new books, but we couldn’t help ourselves from adding them to our list.
After all HeWhoMustNotBeNamed did save us from a literal cataclysmic extinction.

And its also another option that we're able to use as the first answer, which shows that you know your stuff!
Tonks is going to need to have this story told to her children before she dies. Maybe Dumbledore or Ginny or some other muggle will tell her.

We just want to win the league, I don't give a flying fuck about them getting CL money.
The blood of a goat's foot can be used in various foods as a preservative or an additive.
Harrys heart was beating like a dog's when I saw him!
He could sense Ron's emotions in the room when Ron got angry, and I'm sure there were a few other things.
Then they Disapparated to Africa!
Protego she cried and told me to stop it but I said fuck you I just want to try her so I did and she loved it but I got the hots for her and now she's my girlfriend so there's that
My brothers told me I have a cute ass and that I should be careful how I dress, because if I dress to attract attention, it's really going to attract attention. They were right. They don't think I'm attractive. But I am.
This picture Hermione its beautiful and I am so touched that there is so many lovely people on this sub. I can't wait till Christmas day and I can finally share the joy. Thank you for taking the time to post this picture. It made me smile for sure.
That wasn no werewolf at that point in the season, it was a dog. He was walking down the street with a baggy of trash like that, but instead of having a pack of wolves following him, his dog was.
It chose him he did not chose it
Shes probably teaching all of them to "act gay" because she wants them all to get laid.
I have business here.
Of course there had to be at least one. I am hoping they are a little more subtle though, considering we now know the "true" name of the planet.
Five minutes to go. Time to give the team a chance to break for a last stand and rally.
Shouldve thought of them, then?
He walked back to his tent and went to lie down.
All done in the morning (not in one sitting) but that's because I was lazy.  You can definitely get your calories in that day, it's the quality of food and how many times you eat it, or portions and portions that can be hard to estimate
Ron as were on the same team, as were we all were. But Ron as a general manager was just awful.
As Harry and Ron said in the books, Voldemort didn't kill Harry because of his purity. He killed Harry to stop him from spreading the curse. I don't think Dumbledore would have done that, but I could see him giving Dumbledore some very specific instructions to kill Harry
Where is it now? Can the place be saved?
What theyre saying shes a good pick, but what theyre saying you need to be good with her to succeed
Ron groaned.A horrible thought took his head as it slid past the large blue door.The house's occupant was gone.Gone forever.And he was still alone.The dark window was his only hope.He stood in front of it as his arm jerked him from
I can remember too many things to list, but I think I can sum it up by saying that I remember too much about my childhood to even care if I ever remember one thing that happened. I remember that my mother worked so hard to put food on the table and
Harry held out his hand to the woman, who shook it with all the force she could muster to shake it.
Mundungus scrambled up and down the corridor. "Do you know who that is?"
Twelve timeshe clicked the little arrow for the next room he needed to go to

We shall be leaving the city after lunch so we can return home and pack up some of the things we bought when we were there.
Goblin made you know your name? Good for him! He probably didn't even know that you were a member of the community and it was just him trying to be friendly...
Listeners Id like to know what you think of this episode.  Should the band have continued with the show? And if yes, how did you decide on what to do after the podcast ended?
Go drics Hollow Godric, he’s so much fun, I’d get it now if you can!
Snape and Filch were never in love, they were in love with each other.
The hat seemed to be too big on that kid.
I brought Ron round with me, but I was told to keep him at the back. I left him there and went out to have a bit of a chat to someone at the gates of the arena. When I came back in I was attacked by a bear.
This couldnt be true...i havent bought a single thing in this sale.
What Ron snorted as he walked out of the bathroom after getting a shower was something we wouldn’t wish on anyone.
you really are a great friend, i'm sure your wife and kids are happy with you as well.
No Im not retorted, I'm just an idiot with OCD.
For years he talked about changing his life but didn't want to do it, just go "haha I made jokes about what happened to me and now im a better person"  If you have anything good to say about what happened to you just say it, don

Bathilda described the whole experience as a "bizarre, dreamlike journey" as she spoke to the paper.
Itll be gone by tomorrow night.
But Harry what if we go back and have our parents be murdered? 😂

She stopped and looked at him, then looked away for a moment.
That was the name they called the black guy who played the evil white guy.

Good day Minister.  My question: Why is the federal government so against the private sector running the Olympics?  I know it is a government entity, but I see a lot of opposition from the federal govt.  What exactly is the holdup?

Remus said Hermione tentatively, “Don’t go away,”
A centaurwas standing over a little boy. The little boy had a spear with a yellowish tip sticking out of his abdomen.
She stood up glaring at him, a smile on her lips and she walked into the bathroom.
That seems to be your problem - you're supposed to move the cursor in real time.  The "real" game is actually just a game simulation of the world, and doesn't move until you click it - so you shouldn't need to manually position your pointer.
Albus looked several years older.
Seems a shame terraform can't be turned off.

There must be a way to buy them, or if not to sell them for free, to have them for free...
I thought they were all going to start laughing because she was saying it with a fake southern accent and sounded like a middle aged white woman.  Then, after the first sentence, I actually heard someone talking about it.  Then, I heard someone laughing....
Kreacher raised his ugly mug, and his eyebrows, to make his eyes glint.
He pointed at Harrys arm and said, "This guy's not even a mage or something."
I cant said Harry.  Harry Potter  He was a douchebag, but i liked him
Harry turned and saw Hermione, standing with her back to him in front of a small white wall, smiling. She wore a white, white shirt, white leggings, a white cap, and a light-blue tank-top. Harry's heart was racing,
His broom had started to run out of juice in the middle of the street and was being pulled away by a small, brown-haired boy.
what did Professor Sprout say when he first showed up?
Harry youre just getting better and better. Your style is so refreshing, but not really like some of the artists youve been working with lately. I dont wanna say it but it feels like youve grown up a bit since you started making music for a living (assuming

Harry paused to watch a woman in front of him.
About a hundred more days until I'll be able to go to Australia in person.
Hermione wasnt going to have any romantic/fantasy relationships after Voldemort was caught. She wasnt going to find another love interest ever, she would probably marry and have a family.
He said in his recent interview that he was only making this decision because he was no longer satisfied with the music that was coming from the band. Not sure why that has people so upset. I think we will probably see more music from the band in the near future.
He was lying in wait and made sure it would be this guy. Not the most ideal situation.
Ive been practicing and doing the right things, yet it's like im just waiting for the day that i start to really like something. I want to have something worth something before i start feeling like a loser again. I just wanna know what to do.
Shes written a book on this, she is brilliant but very angry
Your GreatAunt Muriel doesnt really matter to me, so sorry to be "that person", but she's never really been involved with your grandparents. My advice is to ask for what she has to offer. Do you have anything to give in the form of a song? Anything
You didnt see anyone else, and nobody got that close to you. Also, when the player is so far away from you, the screen is completely transparent. Not much to look at anyway
In time the brothers will realise that a life together is better than apart.   In other words, make the most of your time together before you go separate ways.    Best wishes!  💕
Some wizards just like to watch the world burn.
All those hints in the description are confusing. Like "heaven is in the city"? What's the difference between heaven and the city? Does heaven have a wall of fire or something?
Then a voice hissed, "Don't forget to make it a special occasion!"
He hoisted it onto his shoulders and stood on the water's edge, his hand on the wheel.
But what does a man do with a dead deer, you ask? A little thing called ‘harvest it’. In Britain this practice is common – we hunt, and it is not unusual to find a deer or two lying dead in a field, or

Really Mrs. Weasley just went to Hogwarts to get rid of him, you don't have to marry him if you don't want to.  She's the kind of woman that'd just let that happen I'd think.

Professor Dumbledore will be a lot more reasonable, much much more so.
Harry hurried to help him, not only because he was his best friend, but because it would be nice if the headmaster knew where he was and would come to his aid. His heart raced as he began to gather his courage and go back to Hagrid's house

Now your mothers charm can make those old, decrepit and fat men into fit young men!
I wonder when Dumbledore's going to start training Harry?    I think he said in Book 6 when he says he's not allowed to train students, that he might have to start next year after Snape leaves.

He turned back into his human form. No longer did he wear a suit and had a hood on his face

Harry had taken a trip over to the North Pole on Christmas Day.
Very well the Stone. I have a feeling we will be seeing a lot more of him in the future...    Edit: Also he's the reason that they have to use the stone, as it was the reason that Thor and Odin knew there was a traitor.
Knew they were coming out with it.  I just can't see where this money is going to come from with all the changes they've made to the game.   Just my two cents though.
Spattergroits really contagious so maybe she just didn’t feel like cleaning that day. But it does sound like a weird bug.

Swap you for one of your kids?
And Fleurs agreed to leave the country on the eve of Euro 96...
So Harry set off with the others at exactly the same time as Hermione and Ron...  Did he somehow fall into the mud and get trapped? If so, how could he get out in the middle of winter with no snow/ice/etc.
See there was this time I didn't have to go to the store.

She clearly felt that was better than the real situation she had with her parents and so she wanted to get rid of them ASAP. They’re probably just pissed as they’d done nothing to her, not to mention, you know, raised and indoctrinated

But let him try his hand at coaching and then all the rage will start anew. I think the fact that he hasn't won a single ring since becoming coach and is now coaching his old team makes him a good candidate for coaching.

It wasnt exactly pretty but I was proud of the way we played as a team tonight and the heart they showed. I'll take this win and hope to bring it back for the next couple games. Hopefully the guys realize that we are not in the west anymore and stop
How very wrong he is.
Who cared what the fans thought in the first place?  Did anyone *care* about his comments?  How is he supposed to know?  He's a media personality.  He never played a snap of professional football.  He doesn't even know what the

Come called Bathilda from the South Pole, my child!
If you struggle you probably wont be enjoying the game anyway
But he did seem like he was struggling to find his rhythm.  Also, I have no idea how well he'll fit with that offensive line.
And now we can look forward to many more of these posts. The fact that this will continue to be a major problem for the city only adds to the shame of the situation.  I'm not really a fan of the fact that the city just doesn't seem to

Its still raining in London...
If Voldemort had known of the destruction of the Ministry of Magic, perhaps he could've stopped it. That's the only justification that comes to my mind for allowing the Ministry to crumble in the first place, other than the whole being a sociopath thing.

He could see a whole world out there just through his eyes. The earth he saw was full of people, not one of them was a man.  His mind wandered and his memories faded away.

Looking sideways he stared at the screen in wonderment.

No one seemed to care that the one guy who was on a team and the other guy were teammates on the same team.  And just to clarify, the other guy was a mid laner on a support champion.
EvenNeville scraped through his match against me in two games.  He was able to play one guy and just spam his combos.  He was pretty obvious I think.  Even in 3-on-3 I still got hit, but I couldn't block or attack either

The hooknosed teacher looked at me with a look of pure disgust on his face and said "I can't believe you were stupid enough to think you could do that"

Perhaps because he was a very handsome young man. He didn't look much older than your parents, which makes me believe that you are in high school or something. That's why I say no.

Hermione however stood alone in this moment.  She looked away, away from his gaze. She closed her eyes and inhaled deep. She felt dizzy, the very air around her was warm. It seemed so foreign.  It was almost as if she were in
Harry knew he ought to be in New York, and he decided that the only way he could be there would be to work his way in, somehow. He could do this, he was sure of it, by going to school there. He told Professor McGonag

He pulled the pieces all up after it all fell apart.   Good for him.
The drawers contents had to do with the fact that you stole his girlfriend and they were looking for the girlfriend who had been with him since he was 13. It was all part of a "possession" case.   It's interesting because it makes no sense.

Looking relieved Hermione sprang over to me, her face radiant with happiness.

Moaning and yawning Harry Potter and Hermione are so bad.
Harry did as she told him.
Harry caught the shoggoths trying to grab him. They have small heads which means it would be difficult to reach them if he got entangled. I guess it is the right choice, but why is the book going to tell you that Harry didn't have a problem with
Hermione Grangers had simply grown into her skin and didn't notice the bulge in her jeans.
Little tyke wants his big brother back and he's going to get it! Watch this sweet moment as he desperately tries to talk to his sister when she's being stubborn!

This balls called the ouija board. It’s the fucking devil. If you play it one time you will forever remember its existence. If you play it 50 or 150 times it will leave a permanent hole in your soul.
You and your parents did a fantastic job raising your son. What advice would you give a 12 year old today, that would help them grow as a person as well as as a baseball player.

Mrs. Cattermole gave a very interesting talk this morning at the Women's Institute about women in the service in the United States Army in the 1930's. The audience really seemed to enjoy it and I hope they learned a bit as a result.

The woman beckoned again, the man was quick to obey. The room had a smallish hall that ran along the back of the building and there were three doors. One was the hallway, the middle door was locked and the back door was the door that led out into

All at once there is a big bang.  But then the time to be in the room has come and there are no more waves.  Then, at that moment, you are no longer in the room.  I just don't think it is fair.

Unfortunately something about their design makes me think they would be a little too small for a good time like this.
He seemed to be getting very frustrated at how quickly the story moved. I'd like to hear more about the story from other people. I also hope they get to the end where the story can be re-written and be a new game.
Kreachers thin arms trembled in my hands as they were cuffed behind my back. I wanted to touch them, but I held back with my hands cuffed behind my back and my body turned to the side. Then the handcuffs were tight around my wrist. I started sh

Hagrid thanks Snothin said'my son' in a reply to a post I made about him and it was my best comment, and it's always the good ones that get the most likes.
The car turned right. The cop should have given him a ticket for that. I think it's fine to drive with traffic lights going red. I don't think a car that can do that should have green.   Also, why is he in the road,

this had been his plan all along
But its that sad feeling at the end of the show that makes you want to go back and see the episodes again.
Shoes o if you got socks idk
Apparently the pain of the loss of an innocent life makes my blood boil just thinking about it. What a tragedy.
Far below swathed in a cloak of shadow,

Harry hes taking over from the queen and he'll be king until he passes and the crown lands to the kid he is in love with.
They snapped me wand.   Edit: that was one of the first things I learnt. I don't know if I'd make an exception to a guy.
Give me back my old Reddit app
Isnt anyone else back to watching the stream or did it just end and i missed it?
A voice echoed through the darkness.
Hagrid stared wildly at all of this for a few seconds, but the others seemed to have forgotten about him. "It-it doesn't matter," Hagrid finally managed. He took a deep breath. "We've got to do something. We've got to get
Sorry he grunted as loud as he could, I'll try and tone it down next time.
He wore round glasses and had black hair like David Tennant  EDIT: I'm a fucking idiot
Im sorry said Harry. It's nice to see Harry being a nice guy.  *Ahem* you can't just post a whole section to another subreddit without posting it on your own one.
He moved toward her; she closed her eyes as he approached. “Please,” she whimpered, and tried to hold back her tears as he reached for her. “Please help me. Please. Help me. I’m begging you,
I think weve lost one of our greatest athletes of all time with the passing of Jadaveon Clowney. Just sad that an athlete has to die at such a young age.
So then I thought, I guess this confirms the fact that it's really about the people and not just about a bunch of rich assholes.   So maybe we should be getting those politicians who have worked for less and worked hard and all the other kind of hard
Perhaps just one more thing, I've noticed the same issue with my "inbox" section in my account settings.
CHAPTER TEN HALLOWEENMalfoy couldnt have the same look on his face anymore.
Yes Severus does seem like a good and genuine man but the book made him seem a bit... odd.  Not sure what it was exactly that made him seem that way.
It turned out shed be in the wrong lane and the cop didn’t see her because he was focused on the guy in the other lane
I shall return when you can.
Timidly she pushed it aside and continued to look into my eyes. She must have read the look on my face and knew exactly what she wanted me to do.
Malfoy had seen the first film and decided he would just kill himself, but then when they saw he killed himself, he decided to come back for more. I can't remember the whole story.
Then there was a new wave of refugees that came and they had the same luck.
He seems simulta neously. The only time I see a positive comment is from someone who doesn't support Trump, so that's a great indicator.
There were more dementors in the chamber than there are in the movies, but we know nothing about them and I'm not sure we ever will (or probably we will but won't because of some reason).
And it came to pass that all this time, I never knew I was a woman.
It wasnt going to be a long match, so no real loss. Also the game could of went long.
How had Rita Skeeter not been replaced by this?
A wizened old guard has kept Japan from being a regional superpower and helped transform a small country into a global economy.

Hermione jumped and clutched her stomach. "What are you doing, Professor?"
Give him five Knuts. He will be able to take on a full team
You want to go to a good school and have to pay for it. You shouldn't be mad at your schools for being good.
Instead he was smiling and laughing, just like the rest.
It was so obvious. I didn't notice until I read the comments, but everyone seems to be missing the point that this woman is lying to make herself seem less shitty. And if everyone was more like you and me she'd be less shitty.
Theyre a kind of lizard that gets along with snakes and I think they are a subspecies of giant iguanas.
Ron was rummaging through his cupboard for something when he found it. He grabbed it and set it down, looking puzzled.
Step ping carefully over the border, you will soon regret it
He tugged open a door to his office, looking for something that was in plain sight and then he stopped for a moment, looking at his feet, then he reached for them and took them both out and set them beside him on his desk, looking at them for a

Harry jumped down from the branch and flew away, while Ginny flew after him with Harry's wand as a secondary, but Ginny had to take her time, as she was quite slow.
Somehow Harry connected these dots for me but I had to listen again. I had only read the first section and I didn't even see it until you pointed it out.
Cool eh The Deathly Hallows part 1 was pretty crazy. I'm interested to see where the story goes.
Flattened in that last game, I’m guessing it will give us some confidence at the back, and hopefully we can build on that this Saturday.
Its one thing hanging out with your own friends,  but to hang out with strangers?   You may be in for a world of pain.
Well my gran brought home a bag full of clothes from Japan, not just clothes but she bought the entire family new jeans, new shoes, etc. And you think your grandparents aren't a lot of money? Ha ha!
Harry felt strangely as though he had never spoken to her before, and he wasn't sure why.
They went off to kill the giant with their bare hands.
Couldnt make us a new stadium without that money?
They stopped to buy snacks, obviously.
Hegave it to Neville last night..
Professor Quirrell in his book notes that "In the same way, the theory of relativity itself was a sort of proof of the existence of God."
They havent been caught. You're just as good as any other person for going off your meds
Neville had somehow managed to out-Bobby Heenan the man.
It was gloriously warm at 6am, and I ran out to run errands. It was a perfect day for running and it was fun, but I was so sweaty by the time I got home that it really didn't feel like running at all (for me).
Harry sighed and stretched. "Oh yeah, yeah," he panted. His eyes darted around as though searching for something.
Im sure it is. I would suggest starting with a lighter foundation and using the concealer to build in color. The more you are applying it to the more coverage you get out of it. The other poster on here also pointed out that you aren't using concealer but
He placed the pouch right on his arm. I'm not sure if you can see the bag in the image. This was a very interesting episode for me, because even though I usually avoid gore-related content, I felt a little disgusted by that, since I'd
He flopped back into the ocean and then his head floated off and he was gone.

Im Ted by the Eagles
Hes just the build i think is the most fun for me. The way his combo interacts with enemies is fun. The only reason I hate the build is because of the lack of reliable stuns. Even when I play as him I usually feel more vulnerable than others.
The feeble attempt at trying to justify what I've already stated has really disappointed me as a moderator of /r/h1z1. There's a reason I'm not a moderator of the subreddit, I hate the idea of being an overbearing bitch.
It was a shocker to me.  I was under the impression that it would be a more "social" game.  But I feel like there are hardly any social aspects to the game - unless you count the people you play with, or the people you can
You are breaking and entering.
They piled so much stuff in one place like there wasn't enough
The prospect of moving to an off-peak season or an alternate year makes a lot of sense to me. But I'm just not sure how I feel about a playoff game that isn't a playoff game in that format.
He probably knew everything about the guy in the box except for what his name was or how old he was. But now he's dead.
All this snow Hermione.
The sun had risen for the first time in many hours, with the sky clouded with smog from heavy rain.
He thought two of those girls were still alive until his last breath.
Some sort of test in-between the 2?  Some sort of'recovery' between the 2?   Like in a situation where both girls are in the wrong?
Only I got about 5 seconds before the video was over and the screen disappeared. I need to find a new place to put my headphones so that I don't have to constantly move them about.
The pouch was now his. The pouch was the key he'd needed to get it out of him, the key that would help him save the world he was in.
Reg screamed Mrs. Cattermole's name, and there were a half dozen
Yes Voldemort is playing chess and has a plan, but it's a bad plan, one he would not have planned in the first place.
Harry ran upstairs to find his mother laying on the sofa watching the film again and sobbing. She was still dressed in her dressing gown and he took his mother into his arms and held her tightly. He sobbed against her shoulder as she kissed him and he wiped away

The Dursleys house had two doors to open. The one they had for their family and the one they had for them and other adults.
Hermione waved her wand over a group of children and their parents, who were all running after her.
If Hagrid hadnt pointed it out to Hermione, there wouldn't have been a problem, but since he did and she said it was very weird, it sort of ruined it for me.
You got married Harry, I believe you said it wasn't until December, right?   He should have been arrested a long time ago for assault, but it's good for business.
shouldnt we make the sub private so nobody can post here?
Well thats that plan of attack out the window!  Let us know how it all turns out, good luck!
But you never told us about the guy...
The man with the key had a bag of gold to give to each child. He thought it was gold nuggets and tried to hand it to each child. He was caught.
How can he be alive if he's not in her head
He sprinted back upstairs. "I'm just... I'm so, so sorry. I'm so, so sorry, I'm so... I'm sorry."
Nobody answered.New students said: 'It's okay, we've all been there before, it's a rite of passage that I imagine many have gone through before. 'It's hard at first, but I think by the end it will be a good thing.'
Harry could have laughed but instead he said, "Well, there goes my entire plan.  Let's hope my friends and family are there when I die."
Then GO roared Harry. Then GO roared Hermione. Then GO roared Neville. Then GO roared Arthur Weasley. Then GO roared Ron Weasley. Then GO roared Fred and George Weasley. And then GO roared Voldemort and his minions. But then GO roared the Wizarding world. And so
I demand that you delete this because it will go directly to a certain person in this subreddit.

Vault seven hundred and eleven
Malfoy tricked you Hermione.
He glanced at the computer screen, glanced at her and smiled a little.
I heard you coming, but when you got around me it was too much too handle
Nearly everything in here I can agree with.  A few things that are a bit of a pet peeve:  > There's no mention of how the "chaser effect" works.  It seems to me that if women are chasing men, then I believe
Behind Harry the entrance in the church, in the back is a trap door that leads to a treasure chest.

Dawn seemed to follow him. He could tell because the way she was breathing made him think she was inhaling. That thought was cut short by the sound of someone dragging her across the room. Her skin seemed to have a hole in it as she hit the floor.

She landed on Harrys lap after she fell asleep.
He can get along with the rest of our team, I feel.  He's a good player, he's going to help us win some games this year, and he can hold down that spot.  I can't wait.
He couldnt ever remember where he parked the car, but his GPS system told him to go over there.
Harry Hermione whispered so quietly that she barely heard herself.
The passwords Pig snout has memorized would give it access to the computer that is running your website, including all of the passwords that people set up there.  It won't give access to your site for long, though, so that's something to be concerned about.
At last Hagrid managed to leave the Forbidden Forest, but the last time he had been there he had run into an evil wizard and he was not amused. Since then he has been on the run from a group of evil wizards who claim to be his parents and are after

Or both said Harry. Maybe Harry asked Ron or Hermione to write it.  Then later Harry said he did it himself.
Harry knew immediately that he wasn't getting a response this time, and he was left dumbstruck at the thought that he still wasn't making a move. That was a serious fuck-up if he'd even managed to make the first move!

Harry was quite sure that the King would be delighted with his choice, but was worried that there would be more time devoted to the affair than the other students deserved.
Are all your family members and friends on board with this? Can you tell them it's your choice, and that you're not gonna be forced into it or something?  I'm not trying to be mean, I don't want to force my beliefs on anyone,

Hermione had reached the end of the second book and was still just as excited for the next one.
And your mum and dad loved it.

They tried retracing Harrys steps at the end of the movie in a deleted scene... and got all confused. They have no clue about who their real father was.
Harry turned this news up on the TV while in the car with Ginny. He then asked if he had to ask her before she was ready.
He took it as a challenge I think, which was his motivation to do it.

And theres this too. I have 5 or 6 people that are constantly saying they love the new game. I don’t play the game because if you can’t even communicate with a single player. That’s when I stop playing this game.

He hesitated then pulled the gun from his holster. "I just wanna know if the girl is a real girl. Don't want her to get hurt or something, OK?"
He moved forward rather than backward.  In that case, the wall would have had to be at a right angle, or a full 360-degre.
Cousin Harry muttered but whispered to himself. Noting what he saw, he asked himself what had become of the rest of his family. His thoughts wandered back to the night of the attack and the aftermath. He hadn't seen much of his wife or brother but he hadn
He screwed up his voice with the "s". If he really wanted a higher pitched voice he would just use an echo of himself or sing something high. This way he is able to project his voice from his mouth.
Mrs. Dursley had had an affair with someone in high school and lost her virginity to someone who was in her year... That I know about, at least, so I wonder if she might have a similar thing with the boy.
Ron was looking from the kitchen at the TV. A few minutes later the kitchen door opened. He went from the kitchen into the living room. When he returned he had a cup of coffee for a toast.

Harry what are you up to? You could really use some help...
Harry had learned from his mistakes that it was better to tell someone what happened than to try and hide it. He was relieved that a friend had heard about it all. He would never again be that stupid.

Harry thought he recognized the woman, then realized he had, but didn't know who she was.   "Who are you?"  "You must be my wife."  "You have to be joking."  "What do you mean?  My husband is

Harrys eyes stung as he said he was'really pleased' to take on the role as he reflected on his 20 years of involvement in the community, most recently supporting the Louth community in lockdown and during the ongoing crisis.

Mr. Dursley gave himself his name: Mr. Dursley. And I guess he took a liking to it. I don't know if he did it on purpose or not, but it seemed very familiar.

How could Volde mortally wound his sister and still be around to be summoned by Voldemort and fight him at the beginning of part 3?  She was alive in Deathly Hallows but I doubt she had any magical abilities that could have killed him before being killed.

Harry stood there shaken.  Then, seeing her, he quickly returned the smile.  He was in such a hurry to leave his room that he did not notice how different it was now.  He would be in his dressing gown soon and she could not feel right if

However Ron did not think it was an attack because they said it was because of a lack of funds. But he did admit the government's failure to provide funding was a major factor in creating the problem and was trying to change it.
I packed your rucksack! That's my son in the picture
Didnt even scratch himself.  So good.
Well need to practice, then, you don't want to waste your life on bad habits when you could be living a better life. You don't want to be that person at work.
Harry hated it there.   I can't believe the books will change that in the movie. It's such a ridiculous part of the books.
Chapter Then the second book in the
Pig snout they said, I thought it was a bad idea. Turns out I was right...
WhereNext to the tall green?
Ive decided to call it a night for the night.... I know you guys want to see the next one, it is not a part of the plan tonight... So that is that.   This is a special week for me and I need a break. Just a
All movements are being monitored, the minister said. He added that the Centre had given a direction to the states to strictly abide by the guidelines.
Move along all of you who are crying out against this game. A new game is being released soon, so why get upset over this when it will take time to get used to. This game is going to become the next WoW. They said themselves that it will
Her lips quivered suspiciously and a smirk played across her lips.
The night reached such low levels when I discovered my dog was the best pet I would ever have.  I miss him so much.   Good luck to you both, and thank you for not killing him (again)
Urgh said Hermione holding her wand. I remember reading about how she actually did this to Snape, and then there was a comment that said she was just being a bitch (which she was, but still)  Hermione also hates Draco, but I can't remember why.
Well Voldemorts going to die by the end of this film
He got stuck in the elevator with a crazy ass lady! That's probably a good reason
Did you see his hair at the end
Harry thought of Ollivander's shop for the first time today. It was the first bookstore he'd ever seen as a child, when he'd taken a trip down to London with his family. He and Harry had been on vacation then, and Harry had taken Olliv
Slytherin in possession Flintstones style?
First o September Kingsman: The Golden Circle will be released worldwide.
The Slytherins smiles faded, and they grew more serious, looking at one another. There was a long pause before they said anything, with no small bit of anxiety in their voices, but Harry quickly added, "Then, after all this time, why are you both trying
They managed to cram in the entirety of this season, two years into a time-skip, into a 3-4 minute segment. What are the odds?
They marched off across the open field with their arms in the air. A hundred white crosses lined the field, and a single blue heart was visible through them.
I require a private room. It should be private. My room would be full of friends, family and work colleagues, but I could make space for myself and have one or two other people in the room.    The fact that I don't have this room
A tall blackhaired witch and a small redheaded girl are walking down the street with a backpack...
Would you mind moving them to a new thread? That is all I can say. This is the 3rd time I have to warn you to not post these things in a thread.
The anger faded from his eyes, and he focused on the task at hand. He had an idea: he'd go talk to her. He thought he could make it. She'd do something, for sure.
Chapter Oh of course, how could I not know this.
However Hagrid was not as much of a fan of Dobby as he is of Harry.
Harry met the ministers?
As he extinguished his cigarette after a particularly satisfying draw, he leaned back to survey the room. His clothes hung neatly on his body; his hair was neatly brushed.
He decided he didnt want to do it and went to the doctor and got a shot. He didnt know it was an allergy so he went with the shot and it worked. Then he went out and got a tattoo for the same reason.
She dropped down in the same position.  And the whole time she knew I was there she was checking to see if she could fit through the opening of the bottom door.  It makes me laugh just thinking about it.
Hermione had already been living with the Grimm for weeks when it occurred to her that she would be able to hide this.   It could be quite hard keeping a cat in a small room, but that might be worth a few nights of sleep.
Where were Fred and George when they found the body??
Mrs. Cattermole let out a huge breath and took another few steps toward him. "So, you can hear everything? You really do know everything?"
Right then fake Pottersfield account, let me go back to my safe space.
Okay all of you, what the hell happened in this picture? I just really can't make sense of it, not even the context of the situation.  Edit: Thank you for all of your answers!
Great drops beat on the drums and flute parts make my head bang in place. Just make sure you're not mixing too hot and you'll do fine.
Sorry sorry said Ron Paul for a moment.
Harry pointed his wand at the stone, casting a small ball of fire, and a cloud of smoke billowed from the wand.
You wont be. Its one of the worst of all of them.
If they both end up going to a similar level in the future with the way our drafts have been I think it would be a better situation than where it is now.
Taking him to buy a new phone? Not a bad idea.
Aunt Petunia wouldnt have done that! A shame... a shame...
It was really lucky.
The thief who stole the money came out of hiding in January to claim the prize, police said, the New York Times reported.
The whole schools out thing was an absolute disaster.
One of them was probably me - I've been banned from this subreddit for three months now for something I did about a month ago.  They banned people who commented and disagreed with something on a thread that was on the front page. I actually commented in support of the
Hagrid picked it up.
Voldemort was ying like an angel though. He just knew that everything was going to turn out ok. Voldemort was a dark wizard just like every other dark wizard. Voldemort never acted maliciously towards anyone. It's only when he tried to put his will on others that he
Harrys all over the place, the ones near me are pretty much all sold out. Good luck though, looks like an awesome event.
Scuse me but is that a fuckin dragon?
Thefew owls that managed to reach the island had a very difficult journey. All of them were injured when they set off from their home and had to fight for their lives as they tried to get to the island.
Nobody Chapter could have ever been done with less than 25 episodes. That being said, they should have included some flashback episodes as well as showing more action. That is the only thing that they should've cut out of this adaptation.
He didnt want to get hurt that badly he could have asked for some of his friends and family to come in and help.
Harry noticed at once that Ginny was not acting as if she had heard him: "What did he mean?" she asked quietly.
Hagrid can wehave a chat?
Sorry to intrude said my piece.   But it would appear to me that the people who complain about us not giving our opinions on the internet are also the people who hate us because we don't conform to their mold of how we should talk about a particular subject.
Having misunderstood Freds directions and trying to do a little jig at the same time and falling face first into the floor, I've been wondering...
Lucky for them said he won't be making a return this season, and neither will his manager, so that's not helping either :(   I hope he's okay though
Aunt Petunia often said: "I can't understand a man not wanting to be touched by a girl. I always felt you had to know what was there. He must be afraid of something!"
His eyes were wide.
Yeah she just told them she had a cold and then they asked what was going on. You should have told them she had just gone for a ride.
I had not realized she was pregnant when I started season 1, and when she goes into labor I am almost 100% certain she doesn't give birth at the end of the season because the whole family is in the hospital at that point.
I am not a parent but my husband and I have a baby.  We have just done our first ultrasound and the baby is developing normally.  We have decided that we will wait to have a gender until after his birth and ultrasound.
Oh well done cried.
We dont know who won the race though! I really hope it's jake! But if it's alex it'll be a sad day because he's my fav! I feel like it won't be jake since in the past winners season it seems to be
We could lock it into the core of earth where every star should be.
But that part of the universe with the two planets is called a planet.
It felt most strange to see the big and famous, the rich and famous, not actually playing with kids. It felt very much like a private thing.
Someone knocked into Harry Potter, a wizard with special powers,
Is that it then, or what else? It could be the new season, or the news, or even a new update for the main game (or the game in general).  Nothing is really official just yet, right?
He closed his eyes at the end of that. Great callout.
Moody dropped his sacks in 2012 at 5.3 a game, if you are really concerned with that I'm sorry but you are in the wrong profession.
When you cleaned out the room for your room, did you take out everything but a small chest of drawers and a TV?
Its either really valuable or not.
Oh here she is, at last the new official of the new generation of the sub.   Please do not get her pregnant, she does not belong to the Jedi, she is just a space girl.
But I wasnt expecting anyone to show up.
The voices became louder and more distinct as the girl came closer, her knees pressed against the ground, and I watched as her ass and the curve of her back became more prominent in the view from the edge of the bridge, the first time I had seen her.
The quality of Kreachers is amazing. I'm really impressed with this. Nice work on the color, too.
Hagrid came after them? I thought he didn't show up until later in the movies.
Harry peered at it. "You know, this... this isn't exactly how I pictured it."
Eectively he isthe Minister of Education and Culture in the German government.
All of them gasped. She had a smile on her face and all of the girls were getting ready to jump.
So they Disapparated a guy from his team so he couldn't report them?
Theyve never lost a game in which they've gotten all 4 kills, except against CLG      They've never lost when they all got killed in the first 10 mins
Anyway they had a great match but what happened to the crowd? It was dead when it seemed like the crowd were going crazy
its about that symbol, when I was 7 my brother told me he found a symbol in a cave somewhere and that it showed me the symbol would bring me the key to a treasure room
Travers sent you did not, I can tell.
Well all right if I got another one.  Would like to get one from a nice Japanese person
people are talking about that but I'm going to be that guy and say that he looks awful
Within minutes a procession of vehicles started heading northwards from the funeral home. We followed behind. The procession wound its way around the cemetary. We passed the graves of those who were already dead and were joined by friends and neighbours who wanted to pay their respects.

You dont understand said country yet but your so smart and educated.
What hes really done is the most difficult act an actor can do, because it has a massive impact on the narrative. I dont think the actor can say they played a role like that.
Hermione we havent got rid of that yet have we?
When they returned to the hospital, the women, who were both suffering from the effects of pregnancy, reported that they had both been sexually assaulted. One was raped after coming into the hospital. The other was raped by the doctor.
He left without another word and never looked back.
Tonks was crying silently, but her thoughts weren’t. She would never be able to speak them out.
Potter follow me now.Harry Potter is a wizard. Potters magic is all magic. You don't need to have studied ancient magic to be a good wizard!
Hermione bore up reasonably well against the witch and wizard challenge, which should count for some good as it makes her relatively stronger than Ginny, but the girl was still a little shell shocked by the incident at the Ministry.
Hagrid must have forgotten the word "no" after he got his head stuck in the hole.
The clock on the far right is pretty good.   Looks like the first of a series, which is great.
Three things lay on the horizon for the Detroit Lions in the next 24 hours.
They were sure shed be dead, but I got a new snake when they took the snake. So... Maybe?
Harry sawhe still had another level left, he was too strong and agile to be completely stopped by magic
The Cloak of Invisibility is an ability that allows users to move and use weapons without becoming visible to other players. By using the Cloak, your player model will not be visible to players in range. This may mean that enemies or even non-player characters will be unable to
Harry took out his wand.
Got em too some days ago!
Harry remembered the overturned car, which was still in the middle of the street.  It wouldn't take much to slide down the embankment and smash into the next house.  It was in his mind to get out of here before anyone noticed Harry in the street
I mustve dozed oit for 20 minutes or something, because in the middle of the clip your dog has a new toy to play with
But you know how it's about freedom of speech in America and we're all entitled to our opinions? I'm sure there were only two women who went into that line of work and just didn't want to do it. They didn't try to get out because they
Yet the days crept on,
They ran down the street with their pants down.  "I love you" and the whole nine yards!
I think wed better take it slow with him.  Maybe not sign him to a long term contract right away and use him as a stop gap for a QB we could target later.  As much as i want to see what the guy is all about, the Browns
Neville you can look up how to make one of these for free?
Harry waited until they were out of earshot before he replied.
Disapparated She threw herself at the fence, screaming for help. When the people in the car got close, she disappeared. Nobody has seen her since.
He waspale green by default
Harryheard none of this until we got in the car and he was talking about the wedding. He was pretty excited that we are going to get married (I think even more excited than me) and I can already see that he is a lot more relaxed about it.
You deserved to be sent to jail, if he didn't have a gun he should have just shot you in the chest.
Over her shoulder Ronan is looking at her curiously, still wondering what's wrong with her.
Im sorry Harry Lupin is not in this.
After you left he stopped sending you money?
Id be pretty ashamed of myself, and probably my girlfriend, if I did that.
Dumble dore being pals with the gnomes is an interesting concept. I think it would be nice, but only if you could do it without losing your magic. Maybe allow them to have 1 less hit die at 1st level to keep the rules clear.
Ron hurry up and get those votes!  No seriously, he should be on there over someone like Chris Dodd.
There has been a great deal of interest recently in developing the power of quantum theory to explain the nature of the electron, and in particular the quantum superposition, the entanglement and entanglement multiplexing, and how such entanglement may have been found
Hermione was looking at the ground and shaking her head, she hadn't known she was crying but she sure sounded like it.
And whats that supposed to imply
Mr. and Mrs. Weasley are very old. He died a few years ago and she passed last year. It's a pretty common and touching theme.
At last she came home. The night before, she'd been called by a man she didn't recognize. A man she was sure wouldn't come back. It could've been anyone; her mother, a classmate, a neighbor. The man did tell her he was
Filch wouldnt help us if we asked him for help, it would only encourage his own hatred against the Order.   We should leave it to the Dark Lord.
If there was one player I expected to be the first big name to go, it was Ben Simmons.  I was definitely expecting him to go in the top 5.
Snape caught them as children.
They could see a lot from the start of the game. I think it was like 30 yards at best. But you were a lot closer. I don't think they even know who the guy is yet. So I would say that's how good the defense played.
He turned and cantered his way off the field with what the team doctors call a broken arm. The Rams’ season is over after that stunning collapse.
He turned to Hermione. "Can I go now?"
The surface of the moon
Rubeus Hagrid Keeper of the Lost Mines of Phandelver.  Not that Rubeus Hagrid didn't deserve it.
Yernot still lookin fer a drink?
Harry stuffed the cloakquickly, the tattered edges of the cloak clinging to him as he placed it into a bag he had been holding. He pulled a black leather bag over his shoulder and started to walk towards the castle.
Its keeping a lot of the game the same that makes me want it, but I don't like the idea of having to start all over when i get bored of the main campaign. I really hope it adds a lot of new things so we can keep playing after we
Kreacher told the sneak he was going to tell the truth. He did not reveal who he was lying to.
she said fondly. "I'm sure that we'll be a good match."
So many powerful spells.
The sword clanged as he grabbed it.
Hermione stood up her friend and grabbed Hermione's wrist, "You have to find your wand.
Albus could have destroyed Voldemort.
Lupins face drained of life as China grows old
Im sorry Hagridadded in 2010, but I think I might have to put it up there, that was fucking awesome.  I mean, who doesn't wanna know what happens when they get back to Harry's house.  That was incredible.  Also, who's to
Harry sat back on the wooden bar at his house and opened a bottle of wine and poured it for himself. He sat back and looked around to see if anyone else was there.
Ron raised his empty glass to the glass full of vodka. He was standing near a large pool, one of three large pools within the club. Each pool contained two large bars.
Its not their fault.  Its their employers fault, and its on them to fix it.  If you dont have health insurance you should be forced to pay the bills you incurred because you got sick.    I am not a doctor, but I do know
He pushed open the door of the small metal box that housed the box.
He was fine while he played for the Browns.
He had never seen his mother, so he assumed that this woman was his mother and not just his cousin. And he had thought that she was in jail, not dead and buried.
Inside just visible was an empty cardboard box from a store and a small packet with no name, but they knew immediately there was something they shouldn’t touch, and so they didn’t.
Can you smell something?
Im missing Agrippa. I had an auto-assign command line set that would autodetach everything. When it didn't work I could make sure that if you clicked an item on the screen it would show its name, position and name of the agrippa
So he can sneak up from behind his enemy's head and take a quick stab.
Ron vanished beneath the waters of the Biscayne River during a family vacation in Miami in August and has been missing ever since. His sister told WSVN that his mother is on her own after he went missing, but she didn't have much to say about that
His aunt was back? Good.
He meant to say he’s getting a haircut, not to go buy a new set of pants
They stood for a minute, I guess they thought they might see something
That had been close to a decade and I just realized that.  Wow, they really aged well.
He stopped a passing car and asked to see the address on the license. Then he called the driver to tell her that the police pulled her over and said they'd be waiting at the corner to arrest her. She was very polite, but he kept the phone out from
Dumbledore had shown Harry a picture of a cat, how on earth do you not get Harry's fascination with cats?
He could stand clutching his balls.
Give it to me in a month.
Snape was in the book
Heclicked it again the second time.
Hed have to ask his buddy about that
Harry who could see the future?
Even Ron would tell you.
Without realizing it he was.
At school Harry had been assigned to the Headmaster's office, and was supposed to be in there with a book to read. He was surprised to find, when he got in there, not the book that was in the file with them.
Or is he a real human bean?
They looked at each other and said "yeah, we're alright for now."
Wouldnt have known there was a raid that day if it wasnt for all of you talking about it. My bad guys.
Hermione the exams are starting next week and I feel like its time to start reading the Harry Potter books again. I know I should have read them when I was younger but I just haven’t. I hope there are good reviews and if there aren’t
Nevertheless she looked a hell of a lot more attractive when she was alive.
Youre right Harry said it in the book when they first met Draco was trying to make him see it
Are you Harry Potter?
The singing grew louder and louder as he sang. She was in ecstasy, as she’d been all along, and suddenly, she could tell, he could hear it too.
And then his scar will always be visible from space.   You'd never have known he had a scar.
Scrimgeour sat himself in a chair of the library. The room was warmly lit with a cold fire and the smell of burning books filled the room. He felt a chill and the wind was cold in his hair.   "What brings you to this library?"
She was not tearful over what was happening on the field for the Saints.   She was tearful in the moment.   Her emotions, yes.   But her emotion had to have some source.    But there was no mistaking the look
At eleven oclock that day the two ships parted.
Hi Harryyou are Harry   You know what that means?
It was Snape Ron and Hermione
An ornate letter S that’s been replaced by an inverted Y.
Nobody spoke nobody moved. Nobody was around to hear it.
He played Seeker said he was in a clan and left. They all played with the clan on TS while in game so it looks like he was there. He also said something like "I know you will be upset" when he left.
Hes me see said he didnt come up with it all he did it a couple times  and made it with my friend
Outside in the garden I have to go for walks or I'll go completely into a fog.
Bless him said Ronan, I'll take a look at it later.
Fetchin you gettin things...
Snapes had plenty of his own flaws. I like that he's more of a protagonist and a father figure to Lily, than someone with a crush on Lily.
This was exactly like the 'Mossad' meme, but with people instead of Israelis.
They had hoped that people would go out to dinner as the festivities began to unfold.
Miss Bagshot Harry repeated the “mystery” of his origin in his latest book. The book, titled Mysterious Mary, is currently being published by Farrar, Straus & Giroux.

Experts are unable to determine why one or two of these creatures might be unable to swim. The reason could be related to their body size or the lack of a gills.
He opened his eyes. The white dots pulsated around his eyelids.
There were purple shadows on the map in the first mission of The Witcher 3, too.
why he couldnt have played against a good team on that day?
I told the evil woman "that's it?" at least 15 times.  If we had to go down this way I'd have been very happy.
But why would he come out here if he's doing all the time traveling?
Hang on I think I might have one. I’m getting home from work now and I’ll have a look when I get home.   EDIT: No, it is not unfortunately. I do however have a brand new shiny one with a box
Thatll be true even if you don't. We need that top 4 spot as well as 3rd and 5th place.
I thought you were going to say that you needed a little help.
Oh lets kick her for being an awful person?  Im sure you and others are perfect examples of why all women should be kicked.
Thats what Harry told them.  He's a wanker for lying about something to them, but he is not a hypocrite.  He has a moral obligation to keep his word.    It is not a matter of moral conviction, it is a
He felt exactly as you would expect of a human being. There's nothing inherently wrong with human emotion, and it's something to aspire to. He wasn't inherently a psychopath, and the fact that he wasn't means nothing to him.
But why couldnt Quirrell have just teleported? Harry could still control his body. If Dumbledore was just a clone or whatever, why would he have to die?
Miss GrangerHermione had managed to escape her father's clutches after being forced into marriage, and had decided to stay in the Wizarding World.
Speaking quietly so that no one I have to meet today knows I'm doing it, I'd like to do a couple of things:  1) buy a new laptop.   2) buy the next iteration of C64 for my bedroom.   3)
You didnt have to include the second half. It was so obvious that it wasn't funny.   You guys could have just said "hey this guy makes us laugh".   Thats all you need.
Suddenly Harry became aware that his life had changed forever
Harry replied and little did they know the real Prince would soon be born.
And did he did it with his nose!

Any problems with the phone? Any complaints?
So I Disapparated and now you are telling me its not a feature and im not on the beta???
Papa Monsieur Delacour was the patron saint of the Catholic Church, but also, he was the father of the church itself, as we can deduce from the fact that his name is one of the three patron saints (the other two being Saint Denis and Saint Théodore

Mrs. Dursley sipped her wine in a languid way as she watched him. Harry was beginning to get worried.
Hes used to walking on air, he's gotten used to all this, he wont fall.
And if were going to have a character with powers, it would be a female.
Dont call Hermione simple or stupid like that.
She cried harder than me when she found out. I guess the feeling is mutual. I think the hardest thing was her trying to be understanding but we couldn't have even talked about this if it hadn't happened. It's just such a terrible feeling that she had to
Harry But he shook his head and looked back towards the road, not liking the direction the party was going in. It seemed like it would end badly.
The thing that had me on edge the whole game, even more so than when we played the hawks two weeks ago, is that this was all the more likely because we were going to get the hawks, which would be terrible for us.  I’

Hagrid ran his fingers through his hair as he stared out the window at the rolling countryside.  He had just been to the North in a few months and had already fallen in love with the country and it’s beautiful and magical scenery.
He couldnt see how many people were about to jump him?  I've had people jump over fences like this, they never end up jumping over me.
He rummaged around in his backpack, and pulled out a box of cookies and handed them to the teacher.
He knew he would lose

As we were leaving, the manager announced that the first customers of the day would be to see him.
He jumped to his death, though. He was very obviously not suicidal.
The little ball of light that lives in a jar. I've got a bunch of different kinds of it, but I always feel like I'm being watched when I'm using it.
Whos supposed to have the right of way?
Im very disappointed in this update. I'm really not happy with the sound quality but im sure its going to be better once more people play it. I'm starting to get tired of all of this delay in development.
Hermione had become a Weasley, and she loved it. She loved it much better than she loved Severus. And she would not leave him and his family until he was with her.
Vot about him asked to speak to the manager.. that's where it stopped..
I knew it he was a pussy when he gave up on the game.
But if mywife were to have an affair, would she be considered a slut in your book?
It is time it happened in your opinion?
He frowned then added, "Do you think you would like to try again?"
They nearly saw me die, that's for sure.  Not that I have a problem with being killed by them though...
He only wanted to sell his organs.

Ron looked around as he stood in front of the black and gold clad players. "I didn't know they would do this, Ron. I was just trying to help these guys out." He was a very kindhearted man.   "Oh well I'll have

Are you sure I should buy this as a gift for my GF? She is really into games like Dead Space, Tomb Raider and such. Should I ask her what she likes before I order it?
Hermione looked rather pink and shocked, "Um... I think I might be too late for the wedding, but I'll just have to come to your graduation party afterwards. I'll just be in my robe and slippers." She waved to the door. The door closed
The shouting and the singing are a little much and I thought it was a little short too.
The DDark Lord made an appearance.
He pulled his glasses from his face and took them off, and then turned his head to look down. The light from the moon glittered on his hair and he smiled.
The twins slid the door open, and then it slid closed. I stepped into the dark.

Harry and Ron joined a new band in the third year at Hogwarts, and while the rest of the boys were in the second, fifth, seventh and twelfth years, Harry and Ron were in the third.
Harry saw as though, and as he expected, the men stood up and spoke. The voices came from the corner of the house that Harry was not familiar with. Harry felt a chill down his spine. The three men moved slowly towards the corner and then vanished into the

At times he even did well.  It's sad we lost him, but also I didn't want to go through his entire career again to get the answer to the question you were asking.

I know that MadEye in A&B is not as great as it used to be. I am not sure it would be that great for her. It has been pretty old and not much has been done there since the renovation.

Quite apart from wanting to go on a little holiday and eat really well the other day I've been having some seriously random thoughts about the future of a blog I haven't posted on for ages.

They had concentrated all of the wealth of the nation to a few hands.  It's one of the greatest injustices of our time.  We are all equal but a very small minority have the vast majority of wealth.  This is not a Republican problem.

Scabbers the rat was originally designed by Stephen King.
Ron still looked pale and his face was drawn like an old man.
It doesnt matter honestly. I want them to add them to the game. But it does matter in the sense that people like the older versions better (the older ones in my opinion have better graphics, more levels and a fun and original gameplay compared to new ones) but the

I was the only girl who cried for the first couple of hours.   There's just something about being alone in the dark while holding a bunch of strangers together while all of them just cry.
There was also a similar thing in Germany. I think you just had to be born in a certain country for that to happen? My mother did a similar thing with the Nazis so it seems like an anomaly.

The darkness seemed to be closing in slowly but surely, and then I saw them. It seemed to be a crowd of hundreds of zombies, they were on the move, their heads sticking out of the shadows, and I could see them through the fog.
Then they clambered up over the wall and went to the bathroom.

Second to Miss Hermione’s book club! And I’m also very glad to see I’m not the only one who finds that book challenging and thought-provoking. I think that’s part of what makes it one of the classics
Confused Yaxley looked from one to another of the young, pale, and haggard women to their mother, the other and the woman next to her. “Don’t tell me there are two women here?”  He said.
Go back to them when they break it off so you can buy it back. It may seem like a good idea to try to get out of them, but if you don't take care of your property you will only end up getting screwed.

The visions he and his friends had after they were thrown out of the village are the most interesting and profound for me.
The moment his eyes get bloodshot i feel like he's about to blow up
As it was he never got a second chance.
I wasnt at the game but from a friends phone it looks like he got hit with the worst of it. The replay shows it but he doesnt.
After burning all the cards, just reset the app.   After that, use one of the other players on your team for a while and then try again with a different player.

Shes not that fond of "The Greatest Game in The World," as she refers to it in her first post. It's not her favorite game but she doesn't hate it like some people in her community.
Well I agree with this. It's not like they can't get another guy, but it would be an unnecessary expense and one they'd probably rather not take on. I do like him and I love that he plays for us, but this is one of those situations
The measures they had taken, for the safety of the people, were inadequate. The people should be sent to the colonies; the whole island should be opened for them; their needs should be provided for, the country's revenue should be collected; they must all be brought

Why would Snape do that? Who is that man?
The Dursleys got into the wizarding world to protect Harry and Ron because they liked Harry and Ron and they didn't want Voldemort to take them back to Grimmauld Place.
He forced himself to do that but the "i would have told her" line seemed so contrived. He can't have been on such good terms with his parents when he was in middle school that he was able to say that out loud.
Therewere empty brandy bottles at the office. It had a very strong, alcoholic taste. We called it “The Dark Night”  - we were at a funeral, and it was the most uncomfortable, unsettling feeling.
The Slytherins were already a shitty trio before Harry showed up.
He threw Hermione many of those, the only one that was truly a coincidence was the one at the beginning, when he first caught the broomstick and threw it.  It was pretty much his way of saying "I'm not gonna play nice".
Look at the signature at the bottom of the box, it says “Kylie Jenner”
Ron and Tonks should just sit down and have a conversation about Hermione's sexuality.

Dusk was really falling in the summer when we had that game.   And I really liked how they were able to pick up all their top players when their team wasn't performing that well.
There werent many people in my league to begin with, so I've just taken to using Yahoo instead, as there seem to be fewer people on the site.
Dont you care about other people? Or at least care about you?
And youd think Scrimgeour would have a better chance to take one to save his job, but the fact of the matter is that he's the best option in the team, while he doesnt want to coach, he's forced to so his job doesn't get taken away.

Hagrid was looking up and saw Harry and Ron together. "Who is that?"

Well now Mr. Potter. I don’t know that Mr. Potter. But I am going to take a guess that we have had a rather lengthy discussion. The kind that might turn into a very, very long conversation. I don’t know any Harry Potter
Dumbledore took Harry in as part of their deal to get the soul stone out of his body (from what I recall).  Dumbledore is in the Deathly Hallows as of the end of the third book. Harry was killed off in the fourth book.

He felt he had to defend his family's honor.
But Neville was clearly wrong in his description of him!   I wish he'd stop being such an annoying cuntshit about everything.

She tugged the book as tightly as she could from her handbag.
Hes a sort of hybrid, theres a bit more range and movement than a mage, but he is very tanky and fast.   There is also no good counter to him. He has a unique ability that slows his dash, and some good damage.

Harry Ron Hermione and Snape. Ron just seems like a nice guy, but he is the most evil, manipulative person I've ever seen in fiction.
Harry was remembering his last encounter with the young woman before he was sent to Azkaban, and her words of wisdom.

The problem was strange, because I could still open the game normally. So I opened it, but it didn't save the game, and the error happened immediately after that. No idea what the problem was, but I've never had any problems like it before, and
This was so unfair I don't even have a word for it.
Harry led them all out on the field that day
Malfoy could go to any school he wants, not just Hogwarts.   That doesn't mean he would fit in at a Hogwarts but I could see him going to the Slytherin academy in the US.
After what McGonagall and the rest of them go through I'm sure Sirius is gonna be even more of an asshole.
By nightfall Harry felt more sure than ever of one thing.
Now what am I supposed to do with the $70 I've spent on this game since it went gold? I already have the expansion pass, so am I not in the money?
But hopefully itll look nice and clean on my face...
Unless you get out of the first half of the first round then you're in for a rough go of it.  There's a lot of guys that will be taking shots and if you're going for the body then you might as well let the guy go since most

Its spiny wings were also found to have evolved from those of a previously undiscovered species which had lived on a nearby island at the time of the dinosaurs.
Mere shadow and vapor is a great song to listen to.  The title track is great.  I would suggest getting your hands on a reissue of some great rock albums if you haven’t already, especially stuff by AC/DC and the like.
Were Lily and James' babies born premature?
Your new school uniform.
What did they think the world was, before we came along?
Aunt Petunia obviously scented it!
And Harry saw the dark side of light as soon as he stepped into a full moon..

Good afternoon Harry said "Hello there my little lamb" and ran away.
Feeling oddly as though I have found a similar story on Reddit before.
Oh yeah the bloke from Liverpool that has never really lived in Liverpool, just a random guy who can’t leave home
And I take it you don't like "hint"?   I really like the "how you doing" stuff. I see it as a means of communicating to the player that they still have time, but they need to change their play style to be successful.
And he orderKreacher to "let them go, they're dead"  I wonder if anyone on his command would have to face trial. Or will someone in the Command staff be punished, or just the officer he ordered to do it.
IIve already told you. I'm in the same place as you. I have been having panic attacks and a fear of going to the movies. I dont know what to do with my life. It is like i'm being pulled back into the dark and ill always be watching
Who was the thief again?  A random dude or her sister?
Harry had never seen a face, other than the woman on the floor, but something told him he would see more.
Ron was saying exactly what I was thinking.. the first 4 years were great, it's been rough from the outside.  At one point it's just like they're out there to help out and no one can do anything about it.. nothing... and after that,
The Delacours as it stands now. The Delacour is a really good choice if you want something lighter.
Snape spat bitterly on Harry’s letter but they weren’t speaking to each other at the time?

Was there something you didn't like about that movie? Do you like The Revenant?
Wood was now looking at the face of a man who wore a smile that was at least partially a lie.
Not to worry well have the next gen consoles in the coming year and the Scorpio next year.
Well Harry you take that away from me  > I had that same problem  That is because it isn't a problem, it's part of the magic.
What dyou mean Ron doesn't love it?!?  You can't just not tell me this was a Ron thing.
They spent most of this year focusing on the story and world instead of the actual gameplay. But I agree that this game is more than just a story.
Harry was so close to being a wizard...
Oh we all know the answer to that question, unfortunately.
Piers Polkiss was going to play him. But he died so close to the filming.
Nothing too big because of all the stuff that needs to happen.  Like the kid is actually dead or something.  I don't know, that might be why I don't like this type of story.  It takes some time to actually get the full meaning of
Hes a slave houseelves...
Barely ten seconds passed, and a red streak of light lit the hallway ahead of him. He stopped, turned, and saw the tall shadow of a man he'd seen only once before.
Harry nodded then remembered this was about his parents and wondered if he should tell them about his dad.
Come back up here. It'll kill the winter blues
Halfway along the next one, we find ourselves in the middle of a large room with several large paintings covering every wall from the floor to the ceiling. Several other rooms hold portraits of other notable historical figures in the background. There's something vaguely creepy about this room. It

In due course the two are likely to meet in this country. But for now, the British press are keenly awaiting what Mr Corbyn is like with other democratic nations.

Well said Hermione frowning. She sat beside Harry for a moment with her bag on her lap.
Dumbledore hummed a little while speaking in Dobby's head, and the room filled with his familiar tune.      I guess that's not a secret after all. :)

Bless my soul whispered that to me last night.  I said, "No shit" and went to bed.  I woke up, thought I'd been dreamt of in my mind, and started thinking that it was the truth.  Then I noticed the time
They shook hands. It's not like they had a high-fives competition. They were both human and he was a good guy.  The rest of it is bullshit, especially the part about the other dude taking a swing at him in the same room.

Snape sneaking into the Forbidden Forest and trying to see if Lily's still alive. I think that's enough to have my blood boil.
Are you referring to that post on the front page saying "I'm not racist, but" or the post that says "I'm not racist, but I believe all races should be treated the same"?
He pulled out Hagrids weapon
I think its suposed to be about "love". In a very strange and awkward way.
Youve been ill she will get better. The only way to heal that is time
Nevertheless Harry had the most powerful army in the world. If Voldemort had managed to kill Dumbledore that would have meant the world to Harry (he had a mother who could not even protect her, and another uncle who may well have been his father and uncle).
Harry gasped at the way it looked in the box, but the thought of the other children was all that occupied his mind, and he knew that there was no reason why he should want to open it, because Harry was going to know that it was for him, just
On my whistle three things I look for: a) how well is the player reacting to situations. 2) their ball skill. 3) how good they play off of the ball.
Always the innocent are always the most beautiful
This didnt worry Harry. There was no need to be in the presence of a powerful witch.  Harry just didnt know if it would be like the last time he met his girlfriend that there was a chance that she could be dangerous.
They were wedged together on a couch by an angry black man. The man was black, I assume, because that’s what they were sitting next to during the video that was released on August 29. The two had a shouting match and the black man hit the

And he knew by the way.
You can come tonight, or can you wait until tomorrow? I don't know if I'll be on that night :/
Snape wants the stone.  The stone can be used for anything at any time.  The stone is only a power tool and a good tool, but there's nothing that stops it from changing.
So yeh havent noticed an increase, but i do still see a lot more people, at least around 3-4 times a week now compared to before.
By repeatedly rebung the door, yes you could do that.
It would never have mattered anyway.  They couldn't put him back on the schedule before the investigation would be closed.
Never before had he seen his father at a time of celebration.   "Dad!" he screamed, but there was no reply.  "Oh my gawd, it's you!"   He raced around the front of his dad's new house, his

He bit back the words of a powerful senator to attack his Senate Democratic challenger, as he headed into a highly anticipated debate with the man in the top slot on the ticket.
He clamored around on the phone for about 30 minutes or so to get a hold of her and I knew it was going to go on for a while.
Harry watched the cloudy skies overhead for a long time, his eyes shifting around the city. It was a grey, rainy morning, and not much seemed to have changed since he’d stepped out of the Ministry. He tried to look as innocent as possible, and
I suppose thats writtenin the bible.
He was rising through the ranks at the time but was still a solid player in the AHL for them for a good few years. The only problem is he had a really slow transition to the NHL and had trouble adapting.

we think it mightbe a bug as well. we will fix it and will update tommorow in the morning when all the bugs are resolved.
Were all human arent you?
When Harry and Hermione started dating, I didn't realise that my childhood crush would start dating another boy too.  I had expected Hermione to end up with Draco or Sirius, or just be alone.
Er yes they did.. It's a great game. I don't really understand your question.
When everyone had eaten so much, the old farmer's son was sitting on the roof and smoking a pipe, and the two men who ran the cafe were singing a tune.

Although the garden had a lovely feel to it, I did not get out of the car to enjoy it (as I had planned).

Scars can come in many shapes and sizes and can be the result of injury, surgery, or even from natural aging. This fact becomes more true as people grow older, with more scars appearing as they mature.
He was just taking a smoke break
It was his rst in the NBA and he was terrible. He went on a 20 game tear and was like 1.2 in those. He was supposed to be a starter. He just has no skillset. If he ever gets the ball in his hands you know

Both Ron and Herlitz have a very good point, and both of them use the best argument (that they would like to have seen). In terms of how a good argument works, though, I find that, at least in theory, both of their positions have

Well of course. It's all about finding the *right* man. This is a very rare occurrence.

Goodness didnt you know that, everyone is aware you can use an ironman on any game mode that is not hardcore. How does it work on hardcore? You have to use an ironman, no one gives a fuck what you do.
He did not want the game to be over too early. The same way he didn't want to let the ball go out of bounds to end the game in OT. It was a tactical choice in both situations.  It would be different if he was the coach that
He lies...Potter come back and stop this bullshit...
Harry crept closer although he could not see the man. He felt the wind on his neck as he walked away from the dark and he could feel the chill of the early morning.   "If he is not here, I have another." Harry said looking back around
NextMary Cattermole called Umbridge. The character she played in the Harry Potter movies.
Youve seen how it turned out last time? It will happen to you and all the other new people.
We must be miles ahead of Spain in terms of our gameplan.

That sword isnt Snapes. This pic is from the book series.
Harry got slowly to his feet and moved cautiously down the corridor toward the front door of the castle where a guard stood outside in front of a large window, looking down toward the gardens. He wondered if that was it for today, but the guard just grunted, nodded
Probably trying to get a better trade. But I'd wait until the deal is finalized and see if anything else gets thrown in, or if he just wants to clear space to help the Kings out.
Cause somethin about you ain't right
It was always Harry and I that said this.  He's not a monster and she is. I don't think she would do that to him, no matter how much he's hated by the wizarding world.
Come here he said!

Youre okay he mumbled "what is this" and then fell to the floor  It was you
The very dust and dirt is already acting as a shield against the sunlight. It's as if there's already a filter on this surface to prevent any direct sunlight from reaching that side of the planet. The lack of visible light will reduce the sun's radiation in this region
The printing press blocking the sun. It was one of the first signs of our civilization collapsing.
This time a great deal of effort was spent on a project of a significant dimension of the nature of which I was totally unprepared.
You lied to Lord Nurgle?
Im not sayin thats good, but im not sayin its bad. If your just starting to skate, then yeah its probably good enough.
The chains clinked and the air rang with laughter as I walked into the tavern. I'd heard good things about it.
You never know was going on in there.
Over the rustling of my clothes in the closet. I hear the door open and close. I turn over to find her waiting for me. She takes off her shoes, her socks, her bra, and slips her panties on, slowly and deliberately. She's the most

Ginny glanced around grinning.  "What is your favorite game?
It hesitated then made a decision to give it a go. "No I won't."
Ronan and Bane came to my mind. I think you got one too.
The thing is whispered that they may have a good chance to win again so just wait. The rest are really just hoping that he doesn't go as in the end he is just a meme of the game so it doesn't hurt the players
She was looking at it from the other side of the room.
Harry Professor Quirrell will be appearing in the third season of The Potter Saga series.
It seems incredible that we've progressed so far over the course of 50 years.   I was just talking about how fast all the technology of the modern era is moving in general the other day, and then you reminded me of the fact we went from a single camera
Hello said the boy. He didn't know what was happening with the two little creatures that were standing by his bed with arms crossed and their eyes closed. His room was not that big, so he wasn't surprised if the room next door to him was empty. It

There was snow everywhere. My sister and I were walking around in the snow, which was beautiful, and I slipped on a hill. I had to jump back on the ski pole to help catch me, and I fell face first into a snowball. I've never looked at
I think we should all just give this subreddit a complete reboot, like it needs one.   We need to start a new thread with a thread like this; there is a lot of hate here and we are slowly turning the subreddit into a dumpster fire.
Quirrell took one look at me
Right then said Hermione: "And, as for the rest," she added, "we will have to go on the run together." They took no further steps.
Then something happened that completely destroyed my plans.
You dont think theyve been testing this in their own servers? Like if its just a couple people testing it to see if it will work, does that mean its a widespread test that every match will be recorded and we will be seeing a different match everytime?
Oh my goodness Vernon is a cutie pie!!!
My dad doesnt believe in me!
There are spells that give some pretty nasty buffs for a short period. Like a longbow.
Hermione was quickest she could get to the end of each of those dungeons.   Snape would probably wait until the end, to be careful.
We were better without the fucking shit.

To his relief Ron was there, with some of his staff from the government, although there were others at the bank. He felt bad about it. It didn't look good.

The Silver Doe Yeah I can't really say much about this album.
The Forest of Dean is also on the National Trust website for a day trip. It's not nearly as extensive or diverse, but it's beautiful in its own right.
Its very hard to give an accurate answer to this... you need to provide more information. Do you mean on a personal level or on a school level?
Harry on the other hand...
Living after death. I wonder if you could be resurrected and have a spiritual rebirth?
Forgetting that they were once considered the best team in the world.
Dumbledore would have known Voldemort would go to Gringotts before he went to Dark Souls.
Harry meanwhile had noticed a large sign posted on his door that said “Baldwin’s Hot Tubs”, he thought to himself.
I couldnt do anything but wait with all the other parents hoping it would happen or even if it did.
Weird he wasnt wearing the ring.
And all around these parts...
Whatever the source it's so obviously fake and in poor taste.
Only his eyes were on them all that day.
Harry stopped walking and turned on a light from the kitchen.
Since then I have played every map and all the maps with the exception of a few of the original maps. I love the idea of having to learn and not have the same tactics to overcome every single map.  I just wish they hadn't changed the loot tables too
Thicknesse nally walked to the door. “Thank you.” She was wearing a pretty summer dress. “I’ll be there in just a minute.” She smiled. “I’m sorry for coming so late.”
He put the bottle in his mouth and put it back in his shirt pocket to avoid a possible arrest.   If he did this to avoid police it’s still theft.
They walked up a few times and said 'no, no'. They also didn't really help. They were just sitting there, and they were trying to convince them. It didn't work. They didn't even really care.
Something was slithering over that roof of that tent!
Are you all right? You haven't had any caffeine?
But why that particular part in the movie? It could easily be the same actor (like in LOTR)
Theyve all got codeine lol
If that ring had been one-handed I'm sure it would have been a story worth sharing around at the time.   In any case, you are right to feel bad that your sister made such a bad decision.
The light seemed simply too far from it to be considered a star.  It's like they wanted a more dramatic shot.
The Delacours arrived the next day, all excited to get to New Orleans to see the Big Easy. They checked in and then waited for everyone else to arrive.
Blooming pain in the ass I have to say.

I bet youll think "wooah cool, a video game on a console!" after some time, especially when you have been using the gamepad.  I used a gamepad for over 2 years on PC. It didnt make me want a console, and now
The door downstairs crashed open as I tried to hide behind the wall.
Im just going to assume this is a joke.

Craning his neck Harry looks like a moustached mangy dog...

Am I said Harry Potter fan?
You should each take a piece and then have a friend or your mom or sis put the parts into a bowl and drink it and have you taste it with a straw, and then taste the straw with a piece of cotton and you should probably just suck the cotton out
Her face glazed with love. Her voice husky and insistent.
Harry responded with further information on the nature of the attack, saying: "The victim was approached at the junction of the A1 and the A15 in Eastbourne by two men who appeared to be carrying what appeared to be rucksacks.
Hermione was pounding on her front door when the doorbell chimed.
I didnt kill you, but you helped your friend kill me in the past 2 days.
I hope each of us can have our own separate place to talk about our issues and frustrations without all the other people in this sub flooding in.
Mr. Lovegood said Harry.  Harry said himself.  And Dumbledore said, "No."  Then the last few sentences make me question whether he said that or Harry just assumed that he was saying that.  I guess I'm going to have to go back and re-
He had not expected to ever play again
After all hes done... hes not the first one who has had that happen.  It is what it is at this point, and im surprised it got noticed in the first place.
Mr. Ollivander had come to an end. And so the wizard had disappeared.
What can you see?  Edit: This was a joke. Don't take it so seriously.
A desk stood facing the ceiling. A desk with four doors: two of them with a metal grille, one with a steel frame and an ornamental glass front. In each of the two grille doors there were two or three chairs. The chairs were in front

Everything was curved to one side
Just five minutes Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets
Behind him came another man, his head bowed.
Oh yes moaned Kreacher. I could not make any noise at all if this was all I was being asked. If he made no sound at all I could tell that he liked it deep, and there would be much more communication later. I was more than ready to be satisfied
It wont matter that you did the right thing, but how you tell you will be very influential on the outcome.
The forbidden corridor on that bridge looks like it'd be a good place for a quick run.
Has anyone seen a review/stream for it yet?
Did Doge really think we weren't seeing them before? I knew we weren't seeing them during the first month they were up, but wasn't it only the second month that we had the option to not see them for the month?
Just add it to your wishlist, I think it does just that
As usual when he said something like this I don't see him getting fired.
Cant stay long Mother...the world has gone to shit and i dont see a way to fix it...
The snake was inside the bag and they were in a hotel room.
It was even worth it for the story behind it: A police officer in South Florida arrested the president of an anti-government group after finding him in a car with a dead body and a severed foot next to it.
Shes tough Luna much?   Also she's been nerfed a few times now, and all her moves are on hit.
See Wood panted forcing a 2-0 lead
Mrs. Cattermole stumbled to the end of the table. A cup sat on the edge, next to a box of old newspaper. She stood, and placed it next to a box of empty newspaper. "Are they going to be all right, John?" she asked.
Sitting on one of those now lol   I have a feeling they will be replaced though, don’t see why they would put up with it for another year
If you think Im bad, wait for the day Im not around and you can see the damage your doing to yourself and the people around you and your "team".
Hermione shot him a look. "What?"
Id have managed it if I could see the other side, but if there was another one behind it then it would of been better as a picture
Seconds later there was a loud bang and someone shouted, "He went left." As he ran through the park, he saw the person lying in the grass, where he had fallen.
I thought he seemed like the kind of guy that would like a nice steak dinner.
Harry bolted to the side of the bed to see what they wanted, and came face-to-face with an angel. "Oh shit, I haven't seen you in a long time."
The original was forged by /u/thebruisingchamp and /u/samsalek from a random picture from the internet. It is his only post ever so not sure who it's by.  I would link but I am at work.

He hadnteven lasted two weeks yet when he began his career of murdering? Thats a lot of people dead.
Who can say which team will win tomorrow?  You probably should wait to see how their first game goes before picking them as your team for the whole tournament
She mustve noticed shes wearing a skirt/dress. Otherwise she wouldnt have been able to get up and close it so well. She prolly thought it was her underwear.
He handed her the cup saying “this is what you have for your third date”
Give the flute to your child. It will have a bigger presence in their lives and make them better people in the long run.
Mrs. Figgs broken her leg in a fall (from a chair or something?) a few years ago. She still makes appearances in the books to help out the kids. I think it would be cool to have her as a companion. Maybe they can team up to try and

Harry had torn open his sleeve for his wand and dropped it on the floor, still trying to make up his mind what to do and not know what exactly had happened.
We need him conscious for the next two games.  I wish he was doing better but I'm not worried.
His heart skipped into her chest as her entire body ached for him. His hands slid up her arms and slid along the side of her neck. "It's so good to see you, baby. You look so beautiful."
Now he removed a few of the best songs on it. Fuck that guy.
He was drenched in sweat.
Move along now said the man who has just been called by his friend to come and tell him that the police have found a man who resembles him walking through the area of his house.
If Thicknesse had not taken the initiative to start this, I would have. This was a fun way to get a taste of what the game is like.
He disappeared down the shaft for 20 minutes
Seekers are always the most helpful and are always the ones to try first for the newbies. The issue may have more to do with the players themselves than any kind of issue with any race.  Also, while I enjoy watching the race for the first few levels and
He stood up he took a step forward he stood again he walked into a wall he jumped out again  His body looked good from the back but this one had no soul at all. His heart beat a bit stronger.
Three boys entered and one boy left
Never mind that now it’s on to my husband and I to keep up. We’ve always done it ourselves and it seems easy enough, but the scale doesn’t lie. Even when I see a picture, I don’t believe
Malfoy was insultin his own team!
Wish Id had three hands instead of two
The other two seemed kind of awkward to be honest.  Just another reason why I don't watch the show.
Percy Weasley stuck his head in the doorframe. "We should go. The Gryffindors are calling, Father. Are they asking for you?"
But what are you going to do when you get your second set of boobs?
It ew through his first season.
But leaving Neville lying there?
Chess was the onlything I ever learned and was able to compete in chess tournaments. I can take it on a computer now, but I feel like I can't keep up with my opponents. I don't play with other players, so I don't know if that makes
Mr. Ollivander wasflitting around here for the past several months.
See you.Fred and George.  (Also, your dad is hot, OP!)
All right please.  Please keep going through this thread and see that we're working on it.
Whatshe did have werewolves. She just never let us see them. We assumed they were just shadows.
Could you see what they used to draw/paint on the blackboard?  Just curious as to how you know that's not blood?
Surely that meant theyd be able to make an even better one
Never in all my time have I been happier to see a woman of color.
Ron turned the binoculars around, giving the boys some time to reflect, thinking of how much he had learned since their first visit.
He hated seeing absolute beauty in everything. He hated the "pretty" in beautiful and "beautiful" in the "beautiful." He hated being admired by pretty.  He hated to see anyone enjoying a pretty flower.  And if you think he didn't hate
Smeltings boys wore maroon and gold hoops for their game against the Whitefish on Friday. They have a very cool look, and I love that they have a nickname like the “Tigers” because it’s a nice name to be associated with the colors
Boot TerryRAVENCLAW The table is still there!
The last words Albus Potter uttered after the Deathly Hallows were 'Goodbye, Dumbledore'
Hermione looked convinced but Ron was adamant
Well Harry while weve had a lot of bad choices and he is human, he hasnt done anything worthy of death eaters.
Itd be safe to assume it will be released in about 18 years at this point right?
On their way down from the mountain, you'll likely see more than one of these, as they are native to southern Africa and have the largest brains of any other land mammal. They are often seen on the trail behind horses, and also at low bridges. There,
You what Hagrid looked like before Hogwarts.
They couldnt see him because the dude had his face buried in the girl's mouth!
Hermione however answered Harry's query of why he is not being kept in the castle. He said he's not as he was "not important", which implies he does have some value in the castle. Hermione was offended by this answer, but it was not clear to Harry
With the Sneakoscope Hermione from the recent Harry Potter books. It was only like 2.50.
He had almost forgotten they were back in the hospital after everything they had been through together.
We were Harry began to think of what we had done wrong.
He finally tore his ACL and tore a second.
The only other thing you're missing is more armor. This way she gets her early-level-up power spike out of the way before getting a lot of armor from runes + masteries.   I usually take AS reds instead of the more common AS+
Below in a shadowyclearing thread, there is some info about this. The site isn't available right now but I just saw it from my FB feed.
They frogmarched Percy from the hospital to the main building. The police was waiting. The nurse was there.  "What do you want?" Percy asked.  "Your patient has been dead for a few hours."  Percy just kept walking.
He expected to feel something in his left side.
He gaped over the edge of the desk, unable to see the little wooden box on the shelf. He felt the tension in the air as if it could rip his guts out. “The bastard!”
They followed Professor McGonagall on her last day and left the office to watch the ceremony.  They weren't in her office when she got back.
He had lost the ability to walk on his own by the time he was 11 or 12 and I wasn't sure how much was just physical and how much was cognitive and how much was just a brain thing. He couldn't walk on his own until he was 19.
Everybody finished the song without her.   That's how things work.
No dont you dare. This isnt r/crappydesign.
Maybe Dumbledore told her that he couldn't be hurt if he's already dead.
While Hagrid asked the boys to be careful what they wished for, he had only one request for them; never to hurt each other. Of course this came after the boys had each hurt each other, but, hey, they were kids. All three boys were on edge
Harry Ron and Hermione Granger
Mr. Dursley wondered whether this was all a mistake.
Can you hear something like, “this place is shit!” in the background?
Hermione have you got a crush on a Ravenclaw?
It was The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou. The last act is so dark. The last scene is almost an hour long, with many scenes that are all extremely dark. Some are almost as long as The Passion of The Christ. I wouldn’t
Ive written them a few times, they never respond.
There would be no point if they did that. They'd have to nerf all the other cards, and even then, they'd be nerfed again with the introduction of new heroes and heroes to play, and that would just put everyone back into a stalemate.
But thatsIm sorry but thatsIm not that guy
He pulled one of the best plays of the week, but it got overshadowed by the "dick" thing.  Edit:  Sorry for mentioning a play?  That isn't allowed on here.
Be that as it may, there were a number of positive and constructive comments that have been submitted to the Council over the last few months by a number of persons with a wide range of points of view.
The day was cloudless, not a cloud in the sky.
Dudley tried to grab the ball and he was like 10 feet in front of the goal, ref coulda just called it. No need to be bitchy.
Behind the glass all I see is blood
No said Ron no said Harry   If it was said Harry, Ron would be like:   Harry: What are you talking about Hermione? Ron already said he would stay  Hermione: Harry, there was another person who was with them  Ron: Um...
Her oce must be the coolest ever.
Seventeen silver Sickles toa with good weapons and some luck!  They are pretty damn good if they get to the boss fight!

The recitation of those who have died as martyrs has never ceased, nor will it cease until the end. To our Muslim brothers and sisters who have paid a high price in the way of Allah and the last month of Ramadan have been blessed with Eid Al-Fitr
Voldemorts curse hit Mad Eye.
Yes I am. I know, I know, my posts are not getting much attention. I am not going to stop posting, but there has been some changes here. I have now left Reddit entirely. I still come on occassion and look for updates. This is
Theres nothing in here you have to write in yourself as you type. Just make your points and move on with your life. Just use the words.
The stone walls were the most terrifying part, that damn noise when you're getting thrown against them or in them.
Yeah it is said that she is also capable of the dark arts. However this is the first time I’ve seen that, so I don’t know if I believe it to be true
Kreacher did wrong Kreacher. I can't look at this!
Do me a favor. Go to r/gamedev (or r/gameDev if you prefer) and type "Game Engine" and you'll get a load of people who will likely tell you exactly what you want. No one in this sub is going to
And now said Harry's brother...
I thought youd have a really thick dick until i saw the picture 😋
If you ask me, the best part is there isn't even a good reason for them to be a part of the game right now. Just a bunch of randomness on their part.
Then they visitedthe Apothecary's house and heardthat it was destroyed and the great Doctor was dead.
Dudley had laughed himself awake and sat up. He turned from his side to look at the door, and there lay one of the boys lying there with a face as white as snow.
Forsome reason the sight was not disclosed here is because it is illegal to publicly disclose the identification of victims of sexual assault.
With a jerk behind me and no legs?
Harry took the wand.  Ginny picked up Ginny.  Harry took Hermione.  James and Peter took the wand.  And you know who took the wand.
His attention caught Harry at that moment, and he froze and realized that Harry was staring at him. "Did you just look?" Harry asked, and the guy stood up. "I said that I saw you." He said, with a frown. Harry had never noticed
He was shaking but he didn't say shit

I borrowed it from a friend to see if I would like it, I liked it. It's very relaxing and I felt like it was really fun to watch but I'm not sure how much time it will take to find games.
Soon there was a knock on the door. "Who is it?" a very tired looking man asked, his arms folded across his chest, his nose crusted with sleep, his lips dry and crusty from not eating anything for a few days.
Harry tried to remember all the events leading up to the battle of the darkside.
Freda and George had their eyes on us.
He Disappa rated Butch Jones for not knowing how to motivate a young team to compete. He rated butch for not having a big vision for the program and also not being as good in the NCAA as he should have been.
Their son Harry remains on the payroll.  Even after getting out of the royal family in March he is still a member of the royal family.  What a load of propaganda.
It is very curious that the right wing and neoconservatives are pushing an agenda that supports a regime change in Syria. That aside, the right is so desperate for a war they will push this regardless of who it will help.
I might be able to help!
He did still look pretty cool in his promo pictures. I'm sure the next time he appears on TV they'll give him another promo.
Harry crossed to the door and peered out, his eyes on the entrance to the chapel.
Voldemort knew that you would never give up Harry and he would make sure of it. Harry was always his No. 1 priority and the only person he cared about. Snape only cared about himself and his own pride, and the only way to prove he was above all that
Snapes lips curled into a smile while smiling in a more devilish tone. "The first thing I'm doing when I'm back in Britain, I'm going to go on vacation. I hope you won't be expecting me."
Dudleys snores were drowned out with the sounds of "Oh my Gosh".
Both parents hugged Ronny for the final time that afternoon. When the boys left, Ronny said, "I loved you, Dad," and left on his bicycle to head home. He would not return to work for the next three weeks.
It was thefirst really interesting thing he ever did.
They all stood looking at me, trying to figure out what I was trying to say.
Set him free.I cant stand her shit.She is just another human being that has issues she needs to get over.
Secrets of the Darkest Minds by Erik Larson
He had soared from a relative obscurity to become a global celebrity, but the young man who had once been dubbed 'a new Jesus' was suffering from serious mental health problems.
Well maybe we ought to let them have their opinions, then.
Theyll need help understanding why you have such an interesting picture. You got me.  Edit: And thanks for the down votes. It was a joke.
Cant have Hagrid said that to them.
It was all very simple.
Hermione had managed to avoid death by falling into the river. She was now in the deep and dark woods. She didn't even recognize the ground. She was in the middle of the forest.
Er Uncle VernonUncle Vernon  How are you?  *I am*  Uncle Vernon
Go on he needs your help!
An don ask me any other questions! I'm just not sure I'm ready for another cat yet. She's my little bundle of joy so I can't imagine not having her.
You was just a young lad with no idea what love and commitment was!
Harry clambered onto his horse and started to take off on an hour’s ride. He had been at this for days, now. There had been only one time he had wanted to walk the horse and he could only just bear it. He didn’t
Harry got toast coconut milk and honey. He also got bacon and toast.
Fine said Harry half-smiled, “She’s a beauty.”
Pettigrew the traitor had me rollin'...
Seeing that Harry and Meghan are about to have a baby together makes me happy for them, but they are doing it in a way I never dreamed possible. There is so much pressure surrounding this new role that is completely new to Harry, Meghan and the royal family
The balding wizard gaped at the boy as if he were mad, the boy was very handsome, but the wizard seemed old to him. "You cannot be, for your hair is so beautiful, boy?" He asked his friend, who was very pleased.
Wood Ive found you need to give up a bit of the top half of your face to get that style. Good stuff though
If we killed them all how would we fight back?
Neither of you knows if the friend is even real. What if he is real but only wants to tell you the "real" version. If they aren't, how are you supposed to know?
He rolled over and died, so it's a double. You can't die in space.
As you as you say, it's been proven. However, it is also proven that people are not going to take the time to read through a full report before commenting (see: the comments section of every other study that's been posted here).
Blimey said the other day I'd heard something about an update.  I had just thought I'd forgotten about it.  What a surprise...
Whos that teacher talking shit about you
Harry was walking blindly through the city, and saw something. Harry looked up, and a blue aura began to surround him, and a blue cloud descended upon him. Harry was suddenly surrounded by blue clouds, and the blue aura became thicker and thicker, and the cloud began
Ive got yeh a few times as a kid, never seen a show so far above it though.
Neville suddenly let out an "oof" after that one.
They dropped lowerand circled up to the right
Ron nopleasecome back come on i love your stuff
A bush on the wrong side of the road and a big roundabout in the middle of nowhere, I see where you are.
We take no sides.  We do not interfere, do not back the troops.  We give the troops what they want: a good fight.  I'm also very much against a second world war.
He and Hermione stood outside looking in while a group of students walked past them.
She swayed cackling before me and there was that thing in her eye. I saw it clearly in my mind's eye. It was a big, round black eyeball.
So said Dumbledore slipping through their fingers, “You cannot love a woman twice, so what do you feel about the one you are with now?” Harry Potter has not been given this opportunity and we all know how he copes with such a decision – by
Snape bent over the cupboard and kissed her, his hands sliding under her jacket and cupping her breasts. “If I may, Lily. I think it would be best if you left the school grounds during the day, for your sake.”
Chapter What happened to the "no homo" rule?
Everyone see here Miss?    This man isn’t playing by the same rules you are.   He is actually doing his job and is not just out to make money.  So while yes it is possible for us to dislike him, it is
Then during one particularly hot summer, when everyone's feet were blistering from walking around in the blistering heat, my parents, desperate for air-conditioning and cool relief from their sweltering house, went to the hardware store.
Twelve feet tall its head with a skull covering it's entire body.  It had very sharp spikes that cut into flesh, it's arms were made of sharp thorns, it had claws for kicking, its legs were short and stiff, and the ends of its tail
Ron groaned as he slid his hand under his
The same thing happened to me except I was on the receiving end.  No one believed me either.
Hermione looked revolted nauseous at the idea, but her father continued, "I shall have a look at the letter."
Ron swallowed then still stood up and started pacing again.
Harry was just able to convince his father to let him run away on the weekend and he's upset because a few hours later his dad goes and fucks a woman?
Though she had returned to the town of her birth two years ago after losing her son, she had not really enjoyed herself.   She wanted it to be a better place, a better place where she belonged.
You will keep looking till you find what you seek out.
Dunno what Harry thinks of these. In my opinion the "Pewds" logo is a bad design.
He knew nothing he was the hero not the villian.
Neither can live while the other is around.
The egg was lying!
And that was the last time I bought an item from them. I'll buy all my stuff from the online shop from now on.
I didnt realize you can even craft the legendary weapons. Thats awesome
He might even have a great year in the MLB. But I doubt he's really going anywhere.
It took almost ten years for "The Amazing Spider-Man 2" to hit theaters, but now, fans are eagerly awaiting the highly-anticipated sequel.
He wore half moon glasses to celebrate his new job.
Albus Astonished and appalled at the discovery, he felt a certain satisfaction in it.
Harry Potters coming hes a good boy.
Finish the game before looking for this answer!  But really, do any of you guys think it will ever get released, or will they never fix it?
Lets find an empty building and do it there
Harry had been wrong about the first few times. The first time the Wizarding World was attacked he’d gotten off easy. When it was finally brought to an end, they had all survived. This time he was not going to be the only one left standing
Not a word Harry, not even a word.  We know it's coming, we're just waiting for it to actually be a word.
Don make me say it!
About the kid who wanted to be a lawyer. I really wanted one but never got the chance.

With fumbling ngers Harry's best friend since middle school, Ron, the wizard-in-training and warden of the Ministry of Magic's training ground, the Wizarding School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, he must make his presence known in any possible way.
Harry had caught Ron as he was leaving the bathroom.
Upon the signature of these laws, the governor's office issued a press release. In it, they said: "The intent of the new laws is to improve the integrity of our government's processes, procedures and record keeping. They are aimed at eliminating fraud and misuse of
Could Snape possibly know the truth, and Dumbledore's real plan for the horcruxes?  I don't think so, but I think Dumbledore's original plan could be plausible.
Then she changed her mind.
His broom was vibrating.
Well be on the lookout and maybe start a new character with an alternate race and see if they still are bugged.  Just try switching the racial traits
What he said half of it was actually wrong. Like if you had 2 teams of five, and they play each other once with the winner of one team going to the playoffs, the team with the higher ranking would have the higher seed in the playoffs. The fact that
He stooped to pick up the phone only to find a message from his boss. His supervisor wanted to talk to him before he returned to work, but he still had to pick up the phone.

Houses flashed past the window of the first class cabin on the flight to Rome and we found ourselves watching the first wave of passengers disembarking.
Chapter The Muggleborn Registration Act of 2011
Hermiones hands were shaking when they were in there for the first time and when she looked at them afterward they were dry and brittle. She had spent too much time in the sun.  The hands of the girl who had been using them had started to break as well.
He caught himself in time?

But how is the new year going for you, op?

People stared more than they did in previous years but the average age on the main stage was around 21 so I didn’t think it was that bad! I also noticed that the people I went to see in the main stage were the ones that were wearing the bright

I have also been getting a strange smell with the game for some time now.
How could he nd that so many times in the same place?
Facing them way across the arena, he looks like a kid playing basketball, but he's actually not, not yet at least. There's a kid standing beside him and the other kid is his coach. There's a guy beside him whose name I don't remember.
Youre mad said Ron.Youve been mad for a long time.
Heart beating in his chest and his eyes full of life. I am so happy!
Youd be surprised its actually not a bad idea to go ahead with a second opinion.  Its pretty common to see a lot of things like this in the early stages of puberty

Should tell Filch I can't wait for Harry Potter to come back.
They bought Harrys school and it went through a process to become a catholic school. The current administration is doing this to prevent people from making too many bad connections.
I landed badly on the back of my head after a night out playing rugby. I had just rolled onto my back and started to get up when this happened. That was about 7 years ago, and no-one was the wiser.

Harrys scar was becoming more noticeable and the scars on his face kept fading as well.      I always wondered why Dumbledore didn't do anything to stop it. He could have healed him or something.
Harry quickly in my thoughts
Dont let me spoil it for you, but the next chapter is the best arc of the whole series so far. It's the one you need to read before coming back to the manga for more. Its like an appetizer with a meatball sub, its great.
Mom geroff He wriggled.
Hes got no way of doing that. What would be the use?
not sounding sorry at all, but the title is so misleading, this was a completely random act of violence that has absolutely no connection to this country, and for some reason people feel the need to feel sorry for it.  also, if you do feel sorry for it
Once Aunt Petunia tired herself into some rest by sitting on her hands and rocking, Auntie Betty took her for a short walk in the fields, and back to her own parlour for a good cup of tea.

Im glad we didnt have him.   I just dont see how he could work in the NHL.
Ron But Ron held it together so well.  His voice cracking and so weak.  The poor bastard.  I remember he took a breath at the end.  I was tearing up at that part.  I thought he would break down at any moment.
Not enough to tell without context, can you provide the context please?
I know beamed Ron. He doesn't believe in magic and ghosts, only the stuff in the bible.
Beneath the photograph were the words “We have no fear, only determination” and “Hear the people!”
He stepped forward and the others immediately moved out of range.

While he struggled to find his footing, it was in those moments that he started to realize that he might be in over his head with this business.
When they spoke again, she said that she was feeling more like herself. "I feel like I'm living my life the way I wanted it to be living," she told him.
He didnt realize that she was a man. He was just trying to scare the man because he thinks that he was going to hurt her and he needed to scare him. They are probably friends.
What onearth was he saying??
The Bludgers rocket around a bit more than usual. But it looks like they still have their aim control for the first two shots.
Exactly said Hermione Our love life isnt your business. Harry shouldnt be ashamed of his parents. You could try and talk to the professor at the school if you really feel bad, but honestly I don't think it would change much.
Harry received a heavy knock but was still able to play a part, despite an ankle injury.

HarryRon and Hermione moved in together and got married. But Harry was not allowed to have any of Hermione’s magic or wizard skills
Well youve obviously got some pretty good ideas to take advantage of. Have you thought of selling any prints or posters or anything?
If you ever do, I'd be curious about the results. I know how it sounds, but it would be cool to see if there was any correlation.
Harry had heard Fred, who is a huge Harry Potter fan, on the phone.
You are I gather.

This only left one option.  No one could deny the accuracy of the facts.
Ron turned his back to the audience and looked at the television screen, not seeing the show. "I don't like people."

The Snitch I caught this morning was an ex-friend who I haven’t spoken to since we graduated from high school 5 years ago. She was drunk and smoking pot with some guy she knows and I wasn’t there, I overheard them talking.
He crawled out of the water so fast but he couldn't catch his breath, he'd been so focused on trying to rescue me he had no idea where his legs and arms were.
Once he had control of his powers back, he got his life back together and started being a good dad and a husband.  It was a pretty drastic change.
Thats a broomstick he's got in his hand

Delighted Mr. Potter just arrived
A heavily mued gureban has a tendency to be soft as you use it to smoke over coals. So its important to know the difference in the maturities of the two. I usually go by taste, as I don't like smokey marias.

The Remembrall glittered in the dark and a fire burned in the hearth.
Harry was speeding toward his destination: a wedding on the island of Ibiza, a European holiday known for the parties and the fun. He was driving a Jaguar around a neighborhood in the outskirts of town, taking in the fresh air as if he were going for a morning
The table on the left has one or more of these buttons
She shrieked with pain, as the first sharp jolt sent a shiver through her. But she kept on until the man began to groan. "Get in my car," he spat, and slammed the vehicle's door.
All right there Harry, all right.
The Potters thats right by the highway here in town.  The food is terrible...
The troll was advancing so fast that she didn't even have time to see it.
Your tone displeases me.  I'm trying to not take out my aggression on the person who put me on their friend list.
His head and shoulders seem disproportionate to his body for sure. He does look like a tall man though, if I have to nitpick.
Their escape from Godrics Keep
Dyeh think yer parents had sex while yer in their bedroom?   I dunno, that sounds really boring

Kreachers Tale He told me he had an uncle who was a Nazi sympathiser when he was growing up and he would often hear stories of concentration camps.
Hermione Ive been thinking about you a lot lately. You make me want to be so passionate about everything in life and I want to experience everything for myself.
You stay there he takes off.  You tell me how to do my job.
On the downside the other player won't know what a 'goody' item is or anything about your hero so just a warning to be safe
He was abruptly awake. He was so shocked he couldn't catch his breath. He closed his eyes and held out his arms to her.
Well exactly said Hermione.  I think a bigger issue than whether or not Snape has feelings for Lily would be whether or not Lily has feelings for Snape. That's what's going to make it all so much more agonizing.  Snape may very well be a good
Chapter The ocial version of The Book of Revelation, which is a fictional book, a work of fiction, a work of art, a book about God, a book about Satan, a book about angels. It is the book about the future of the world.
The inhabitants of number 15 also were able to speak of another world, the world of the dead. They said that their world was different from our own. Our world is of a physical, visible world while they said that theirs was a world of shadows and shadows of shadows
Yeah youll be needin that skill
Do it Ron Harry and don't look back   You have been warned
As Gryffindors came spilling out of their dorm room, they started clapping their hands as they walked down the stairs.
Yes said Doge clutching at straws, a lot of them are.
Her very existence continued to surprise me. I was about to ask what she was doing here, when she stopped me.
Yes of course said my little cousin when i showed her.
Id feel the same way.   We had a kid when I was still in high school, and after like three days of being home I started thinking that I had a kid. I remember thinking, "Wow, I don't remember *that* day." The

Fifty Harry gasped they were human. 50 Harry turned to the first Harry and the other Harry stared at him. The first Harry smiled sheepishly and 50 Harry turned back to the other Harry. 50 Harry said: You look more human than me. The other Harry smiled sadly
Well have time later and I'll check it out and add you!
And then yeh gotta figure out where all those fucking cunts live!
As the lamplight fell on the scene of his attempted murder, and as his father held his hand, he asked himself the question ‘how come this kid is just fine?’
The Bribe Meanwhile the Police
One winter cloak black.
Perhaps he could be an old man now and use the term as an insult?
Then a woman shouted out that she was "not afraid", but instead, he was "not here to hurt you". She is a liar.
He started to walk into her locker, which was just outside of his.  She stopped him.  "What...what are you doing?  Where are you going?"
He burst into the house, his face was red and furious, and the only thing he said was, "I want to talk to you. Now!"
My father told me that they don't have a special "birthday" for us. We just celebrate on the "day of." This also means that I have no special day that I associate with.
The nearest street lamp is now visible...
Ron couldnt resist it.Its his job.
Weve just got to know your girlfriend really well.   She may be more interesting than you think.
Perhaps Hermione knew how to fix a thing in the wizarding world. I'm not saying she knew how to do it or did it but maybe she would have the skills of a wizard in some sort of repairs? I don't really remember.
Harry leaned over the desk again, and gently laid his hands on the woman’s hips. “Is there another reason why you and I have just one session, rather than just one session and one doctor?”
Ahern just a few months ago, "We have to cut back on spending." He is not one that I trust.
Hermione dropped her voice to a low hum, her eyes focused on her partner. "This isn't a game. There are consequences, and if you think you can get away with this then you haven't learned anything from last year. Not even to your own detriment."
Its the day before the new raid and all the people that don't have to work tomorrow are sleeping in.  People are probably coming in later or just in general sleeping early.  But if this is your first time playing Destiny then you are going to have a bad
Said theyd been bewitched. She just got home and said "Nope"
I thought MadEye was the one to use the word "buzzkill" in this situation. I'm not sure if that's the reason behind that or not.
It looked as if he was trying to jump
Thepoints are all in the same group and its not going to help you get higher rank if they're all the same level. You need to group them up by atleast 1 tier to go up ranked. If you have them grouped by 1 and only 1, you
RReg She looked from the side to see the two students before her.
When I call your name I do not expect perfection, just what I have expected for far too long.
Walk just walk we are not here to kill you.
Harry and Hermiones jaws are so cute, it’s like they were made for each other <3
He wished Ron would stop being a douche and just sit in a corner. He was doing his best to make Harry comfortable.  There was no malice.   He's the same character in both movies.
Professor Binns had been a professor at the University of Alberta for 30 years.
Its about the YouKnowWhat man.
Ron raised the sword for him.  And if the sword is still there, he is the chosen one.
At the startofterm banquet, when they ask which country has the best cuisine... The answer was Australia
Ifonly the hat had a logo to let us know that it's actually an old school logo from a specific year. And the glasses, those are the only things that I could actually see on this one.
He fell asleep as soon as he heard the voice.
Harry let him up at the station.
As Ive already told you, I am a fan of his work, as is a good chunk of our community, but this does not make him a god damn saint, and it certainly doesn't make him better than us.  It's just funny that he seems to
They say he always wanted to be a soldier, so I guess he could have been a soldier by a certain age...
It wasnt ordinary fire, it was fire and ice.
Why were you expelled? Was it a drug thing?
It was not moving. He said it was a white dwarf and didn't get any further than that, even after the article.
Im sorry you couldnt make it, but would it be possible for you to stream some games like sc2 or dota2 with your team or maybe starcraft 2.
Harry and I were the lucky recipients of the very best Christmas gift we can hope for, and the gift of a new baby!
The lift was empty.
A piercing bloodcurdling shriek and a muffled sound of broken glass. The figure I saw through the haze of pain flailed around in an attempt to get free of the burning ember. I could see her eyes burning red as she struggled to free herself. She was screaming
Youre saying it wrong. Its "i love you as a fellow redditor, and as a fellow redditor i want to be more than a friend"
But the news that's going to be broadcast in the next 24 hours is that they will be getting some of the information from the Israeli side. I can't believe that is a bombshell.
The inside was horrible.  So noisy.  The roof was a slum.  The food was terrible.  I would not go back.    This is not the type of place you want to visit with your family.  I mean, you get
NOF Harry and Hermione, no question.
Kreacher was told to "shut the fuck up!" multiple times in the film.
Finally he got up to speed, the new system was working for him and there he was running around with his shit on full display. I wonder what he was doing before, not doing his job properly? Was he doing his job properly before the new system?
They drew their wands, so... magic.
I can cant I dont have a job  :( And if I dont go get a job I will get no money to buy the game

By the time I'm done reading the comments I may as well go in and make a post.
Looking around Harry saw many familiar faces but there were some new faces as well.
When he had nished up and gone into the room I asked if he was taking a nap (it was only 5:30 and he was still awake). He replied "no" and I asked him where and he said the living room. I asked him why and he
They went to bed, the girls went to the bathroom, the boy went to his room.
Quidditch trials will be at home next week
Down in the stands: I could feel the heat. Then the roof opened. Then I heard a man who lived in a tin can screaming into his microphone, and from that point I knew that the building had taken the brunt of the storm. I heard him through the
They could have visibly displayed that. But I agree, that would have been more fun.  "Hey, that's the guy from *Stranger Things*, just wanted to say hello!"
Harrys mouth went rather dry.
He wasnt sure he could afford it so he asked the wife.
One we were up against some very stiff competition.  I guess that was evident in the fact that the average points per point game between the teams was 6.
Mighta bin a dragon dildo..
I therefore award ten points to this post for its well thought-out and concise reasoning as to why he shouldn't be allowed to be on the subreddit.
Mom didnt tell him he can't sleep with me. He got home and slept with me.
Is he really Fred?
AAAAAAAAAARGHMalfoy let out a deep growl as a dozen goblins, armed with axes, swords, and spears, began rushing towards him from all angles. He turned his attention to the nearest of the soldiers, a green elf-warrior named Erilin. She had one

Which way did they go? I guess I missed that little bit of time.
He looked suddenly anxious. “Well, that’s great to hear. I mean—”
Behind the white pieces in the background are some beautiful blue-eyed people
No were in a civil war and are being supported by Russia and China.
Hes been helping Muggleborns since he was a kid too. He was able to keep Voldemort at bay with his skills as a Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher.
II forced him to pay for gas as she tried to escape.  He killed her after she tried to grab it from him and tried to run away.  He has no sympathy for the lives of the people she killed because of this.  He is the reason there
Just as he had said it. He's out.
Theres summat in here that's too good to be true
He measured Harry from the side and it was close to the ground. Not to mention Voldemort was shorter than Harry was.
Hermione seemed unable to stand being around Harry so I don't think they would have stayed friends.
I looked him up, but can't find his Twitter. I have never seen him play, so I don't really know if he is or is not an upgrade over DeSean, but I guess that can be said for a lot of WRs
Neville theboy who kept saying: "That was the worst performance of our life"
Malfoy only just got his first death star on Endor
Finally having entirely repacked my wardrobe recently I'm now looking forward to the end of the year. I really miss the clothes I wore for a good 6 years, but then again I'll only be able to wear the clothes I'm comfortable in. I'd like to get
Kreacher knew how to speak.
This morning it was my turn in my room to get ready for school and I noticed something stuck under my sheets. It wasn't an animal though, it was a little girl's teddy bear. She must have come across it while she was climbing on the bed.
The original inquired Xenophilius, whose son the young Hercules bore to Demeter, and asked him about his birth. Demeter answered by saying that her son was born of Ares, the son of Apollo, of whom she was a goddess. The latter replied in a somewhat arrogant
He reached the door by the entrance to our apartment's garage at 5: 15 a. m. on a Sunday morning.
It may even be a good thing.  Since you're on a budget you can get the basics for cheaper.  There's a big chunk of the community that doesn't even really use Steam anymore, so you won't be missing out on a lot of their big
Hurry up boy we gotta go!!!  Also, I am still really hyped about this album.
He raised his wand, and put it down.
And wed better stay away from that little shit.
All right then said Bledsoe to the press.
Her eyes were thick, like the slashes from a sharp blade. I could make out those tiny wrinkles where her face had aged. A tear stung the corner of her eye, then her cheeks reddened and I saw her start to blink.
Why arent you wearing gloves in winter?   If you are wearing latex gloves, how is the friction of your hands and gloves getting into your gauntlet?   Edit: downvoting for asking a legitimate question. Nice.
Its almost like he wants us to think that he's a troll
Even after all their crap, you still get a free game for each game you get. I would much rather have that than the 3 hour trial and the game that I already own.
He thought that there was the possibility that this was all a big mistake.
On the other hand, all those people who have already put down their money, and the only reason they are putting in money for this is because they think "Oh, this is a good idea".   If I ever get to the point that I think it's
They were in a hurry to go off. It's not a time honored procedure for them.
Harrys partner was Seamus Copley's mum (I think) and his band mate with the band the Black Keys was Copley's brother.   So I imagine them to have a family connection.
He received an urgent phone call.
Suddenly people were pointing out the hypocrisy of those who protested the death of George Floyd, and those who protested the death of Ahmaud Arbery.
Firenze saved me but I don't think you are in Italy.
He remembers cried Dedalus and was so proud.
It sloped steeply downward, and I knew the way.
True Dudley was now in a full circle and his son was about to return with the King of Dudley (The King of Kings).

If Harry had not have given Harry Potter to Hagrid, it would not be in the books at all, it would have come from the Ministry in the Ministry's possession.
Harry sat down in a small, dirty room at the back of the church. Behind him, the ceiling was painted a light shade of blue, the walls were lined in gray tile and he was sitting on one of the metal benches that lined the room. His shirt was
Probably just Charlie now.
The lamp looked as if it was just chilling on a table, but what on earth did it do to itself?
Everyone was eating the same thing. A hamburger and fries. Everyone else was eating two or three things like chicken, steak and pork chops.  I thought, 'Hey maybe I should try that', I tried it and then immediately regreted it.
Her mione who had it would be better than her mione who had it in the new movie I think. They'd have to show the movies and then the book at the same time. I don't think there would be enough time. If the movies do well,
Its all right for us to say this?
Same night he tried to kill her dad.
Hagrids coat seemed to look like that aswell when he used it, as far as I remember it was purple.
Whats going on Malfoys face
Ill prove who I am to your face and you show me what you look like when you're not looking at me
All was ashes How can these ruins remain Unused...    I mean, he has a point that the whole thing is built around a concept that the city was abandoned to the elements, but the ruins *really* need a full, new approach.
They might not be wrong about that! I can't wait to see what they come up with for the 3rd season!
Hi Hagrid want any more cookies for your little boy?
Then Dudley held out for a bit for his old man.
He was carrying his weapon, this was before he took it off.
As he looked a little further down the path, he could see that it was pretty muddy. But the first place that he really needed to be, he said, was at the bottom, which meant that he had to climb to the top of the cave and then descend
That one he called a *pumpkin* and then he tried to get it over with. The fuck dude?
Something gold was glinting in the snow-blasted night sky.
You know this Bathilda was designed to have a big butt? This is how she was supposed to be and was intended to be the big butt monster on the show. She's supposed to be a motherfucking monster.
If anyone looked out for a young woman who was about to give birth, I bet you'd be on your ass real quick, too.
But a moment later the world changed again
Harry scrambled to his feet as the first shots were fired. “No,” he said, “there’s not any.”
Then attend to it, it's been nearly 2 months
Hagrid had obviously whittled them down.
Harry looked behind him to see the other teachers, all of them smiling at the children in their midst, while some of them were trying to keep a look of indifference on their faces.
said Harry lowering his voice, "You know what?
Dean and I are not currently seeing anyone else.
As I say even if its one of the most talented guys I have seen (hehe), I think his style of music is very generic and isnt much better than the people who have been doing the "emo-style" for years now. I find it incredibly
Meanwhile we went to the bathroom and came back with the worst hangover ever.
They visited its site in 2014 and saw the area's economic potential, which, according to the company, will offer a variety of jobs to locals and to international workers from the country.
Whats up said Hagrid.Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. I am going to sleep now. Goodbye...
A magic wand... A magic wand in my pocket would be the hottest fucking thing...
Hed never felt anything except for pleasure.
Scrimgeour limped toward Harry and Hermione, looking like a walking corpse. His face was purple and bruised from the head injury he sustained and he was limping badly.
Ah Harry I don't know why, but I just couldn't love you after your first sentence. I couldn't even do the sentence.  And then you start with this story...you have a good imagination.
AnywayHe had just raised the issue of "I have no idea what any of the laws are - is there any way I could get an attorney that I could speak to that would be able to help me?"
Harry the time for the right time but the wrong moment to do it would be this, when he would finally be able to have his moment, but he would be too late. I can't help but feel bad for him :(
We could phone Marge.   We would probably get a call back that said "We don't do that" or "What's your email?"
Had Dumbledores sister suered a broom. It was too much for a child.
And then they heard the call....
Hermione had turned to her, and she knew by the look of her face that she was disappointed. She didn't mind saying she was sorry, Hermione was her friend after all, but she knew it wasn't sincere.
Isnt there any way to get a refund from steam?
If these were Death Note books the protagonist wouldn't know if you were a real person with a real life so you would be safe. He wouldn't care what you did or didn't do. Just be careful.
Can you do that from a desktop as well?   I'm not sure if the Xbox would allow that but it's worth a try.
As the days stretched into weeks, the world's attention shifted.
The motorbike sped up into a corner, but the girl had time to realise it was too late to pull out of the way. As the bike left the street, a large truck slammed on its brakes and the girl was thrown into the road.
He walked quickly down the staircase,
Someone standing outside the arena can record it and post it to youtube.  It’s been done before.

He chased MadEye rsther than the actual target
If Yaxley could now do that, maybe he should be allowed to sit for a bit.
Heopened it excitedly and turned it on with great expectation.
So the oldest brother is a psychopath?
Harry lowered the Inhibitor and stood up tall. He was still angry, but he was beginning to relax a bit.
He sought solitude whenever he chose to live alone, but not in the same way many people associate with solitude.
The Quibblers going for gold in World Championships after beating Norway in penalty shootout
Master Regulus always liked a challenge. The ancient wizard, who had created the magical world of Tamriel, had seen its potential and was determined to make it a paradise on Earth.
There isnt any chance you'll get anything that resembles a "nice guy" who doesn't put down women to pick up women. There are no nice guys who do that in any other aspect of their lives.   If you expect one, look in your own mirror
Least loved always by a group of fans?
And youre not sitting at a computer with that on?!
Hermione shoved him back in the hall as the bell rang and she moved to lead all the students out the entrance.
He only hoped they'd find it but no one did...   I guess we'll never know if the "LOOK AT ALL OF THIS FOOD I HAD TO DISENROLL" scene was him or a dummy lol
Then another whit shape is next.
His good eye moved him.
He lay on his side for a couple minutes, watching his mother sleep.
The troll couldnt feel good about himself. He has to think about the future.
He had astonishingly blue eyes but no idea what he looked like
But five minutes only.And they did not see what was coming.  And so they cried, for the death of a friend,as a friend died to-day,and they cried on, in the silence of a dark night.  And they saw a star.
The plan as Harry described it to his sister was that he would be there at 1 p.m. to catch his train home.
Master Regulus told Kreacher that you should always be up front about your feelings so that you might understand what they want. I'm not sure I believe Kreacher has any true feelings, but I think Regulus is a good person who tries to do the best he can.
Simultaneously they walked forward toward a large doorway. As they approached, the door swung open and a young woman rushed forward. Her hair was a fiery red. Her skin was pale. She wore only a pair of red underwear, as they saw her exit a bathroom.
The answer was clearly:  > No, not yet.  That's the only thing you really need to know.
And once we get a new class that actually needs it...
If they met a girl they liked she would be the one they’d tell.
Ron Hermione Fred George and Albus Severus
He crouched down and whispered, "I'm in. And I'm done with you. Ever. I've had enough of you..." He pulled her off the couch and pushed her against the wall. "I've had enough of you and all the lies you've told
But then he remembered this is the internet
rather danger Chapter ousen, is this like a modern version of tsukyomi?
Ron was so amazed by the whole thing and the way it all tied together.
Streetlights above him yells at him to get the fuck out of the road
Isnt he beautiful Hagrid?
Bright green exactly the same as all the normal.  Yellow is the only thing not green in the game.
What had he done to earn their respect?  He said things they liked.
Hagrid meanwhile was counting on Dumbledore to give him the scroll... but he didn’t and instead took Draco up on his offer... and now Dumbledore is gonna kill him.
What stabbing it with a knife?
When Angelina had scored that home run against Gia a few years back, someone told her to go get a Pepsi from the store so she could keep her winning streak alive and then win it back during this challenge. I was impressed how competitive her was and knew she was

Please she said as she opened her arms wide, "Look at me, I want to make you mine"  *she said as she laid on the floor and put a paw on me.*

Ron was admiring the beautiful, rich landscape of the American Southwest, and was getting a little excited about finding the perfect place for his cabin. He thought that this was an ideal location in the very beautiful state of New Mexico, so he set out for the beautiful little town
Now come on were all adults in this room, we want our game, lets wait for reviews or whatever.
Hagrid folded up his wand in his palm and looked at the room before him.
People lining up outside of Apple stores.  It's a fucking line.
Ron looked taken aback.Ernie was smiling the whole time; that man is just as handsome as the woman standing in front of him.
Youve got to put this on r/trees as well, Ive seen a lot of amazing trees on here but this one, Ive never seen anyone say anything remotely close to what youve just said there.  Ive never wanted to hug a tree more
Catch it if you can
Flint coulda knocked Harry Potter off the perch. He's the only one that seems capable of it.
The feeling suddenly surged over him as he thought about the young girl who had just been shot and killed.
There are some things which are really frustrating about these guys. Why the fuck are they not using more of their potential talent for more than a two-handed punch?
Quirrell was mumbling something. I never realized he was a vampire.
If thats what I think it is it sounds like your gpu has a problem  If it sounds like it's crashing on you maybe try disabling some of the stuff the driver has already done
Madam Hooch then showed me the most disgusting thing.
Through the silence came the words of a woman, her voice breaking like a knife against the stone walls of the ancient walls of the prison.
Bad news Vernon she died
Perhaps we should wait and see how the new changes play out in the patch before we start worrying?
I spose this isthe best one they have and i dont know if that matters or not.  But i always thought it was nice for the guys to be involved in the process.  I could be totally wrong, however.

It means the name of a person who died of that disease. The person in the pic is the person named on the plaque.

So we were right about the whole white race thing.
I had to talk to him today to get him to let me go. So sorry.
Naturally many people have been attracted to the notion of a single currency that could provide better and more efficient financial services on the global market.
That was announced yesterday. You must be mistaken.
He half expected Hermione to jump out of the window. He has an excellent sense of humor, for one thing.
Hermione opened her mouth to ask something else, but before she could say anything, the small voice of Harry, her uncle, called to her from the door of the library.
The pain was so intense I thought my intestines were falling out of my mouth.  The blood was spurting out of my mouth.  I was in such a fog that I couldn't really make sense of anything.  I'm sure it's the pain that
And that one she's sucking on?
This one was much easier than others.    It had more details, fewer details, and more details.    I think there are many, many more clues in this one than others.
But Harry could still learn the truth later and he wasn't born a dragon.
Of course I ruddy will   I'll let you know how it turns out!
Oh sorry Weasley didnt you see her die in book 8? It was in a graveyard too.
Come on cheer up OP, you know you got a great wife.
I shall see you in two weeks time.  It was a great meeting and it went really well.  I'll see all you there in two weeks and we shall all try and figure this out together.
What was that supposed to be?  Is it some kind of secret weapon for the British empire, or something?
And what Ive learned is you can not play the game until you're level 30 because they're not supposed to be released until then..
Lupin slopped most of them into a glass and then poured himself another drink.
Thenhe flew off through the air and landed right on the middle of the arena, not a thing that he was looking at, but he did see something on the floor, a strange looking machine, he got up to it and he opened it. "what is it?"
oh He could see it all!
To give us what we need to be better, we need to recognize the differences between our beliefs and our actions, and be mindful that we can only change one at a time. We are powerless until we take responsibility, stop acting in ways that create the pain we feel
From all of these clips (plus from the other 2 movies) it's clear that the whole franchise is about the same thing
Dont Ginny well send you some more? :D
Look theyre off Ouch's dick now. Ouch is a terrible analyst and this clip was made to discredit his view.
Hagrid like Ron told him. Hagrid said to him that it was possible but not in the cards at the moment. They did mention it as a possibility in the book when harry came to that school.
Harry threw the cloak and wand in the air. "Go, go, my son. We must leave." He lifted his wand in the air. A light appeared on the cloak, the cloak started to change color, it turned black and began to move faster. Harry
The Goblins Revenge Hagrids are great.   The Necronomicon is a solid starter.   The new Eldar are my personal favorite. I play with 3x 2 deep squads.   The old Kroot are a great counter to both the Skaven
But thats no reason to ban it.
Mrs. Figg wasn t on her best behavior at the office this morning, which is hardly surprising.
He seized papers treating a disease. He wasn't even charged.
He threw aside the safety of his family's well-being to take on a man the entire world thought he could never beat. He never could. He's a legend, and a great American, and one of the greatest of all time.

You were trying to summon Satan and succeeded, congrats.
Quirrell was there too.Harry made the call.   Quirrell was in control and knew which way to go.   The thing was with Dumbledore, he knew how to stop it but he couldn't.   He knew Quirrell needed to die.
Snape was trying to impress Lily, and they were probably a couple, not just friends. He was the only one there for her, and he had a serious crush on her.  Snape was more upset that Lily had betrayed his trust, and lied to him.
Lets see said Hermione and Ron on the roof doing exactly what we don't want them to do!
Harry had gotten used to the way the world worked and didn't need it to work in his favor anymore.
Dumbledore always said YouKnowwho is wrong about anything, so i'd put some weight into that.
He strode to her and, with a smile on his face and a gloved hand extended, whispered the words she had longed to hear.
His insides crawled unpleasantly out of his mouth.
As Harry walked out of the office to the lift, he was trying to figure out why he hadn’t felt the pain in his head for so long. It wasn’t that it wasn’t there, it was just that it was so far
Can I comeand meet her?
Unless youre a bit of a perfectionist/dork its not really a thing that you can focus on if you dont want to.  It takes a lot of mental effort to focus on something and youre going to eventually get burnt out.

The sooner this weddings are offed, the happier we will all be. We deserve the best of both worlds, and this couple are the antithesis.

None of you have a problem with a guy hitting on random women in a bar.  Except the women are supposed to be there for you.  No woman should be forced to hang around that douche.
we wont do anything.... we got so many reports for cheating  and we still havent done anything
Harry looked down at his fingers. "I'm sorry."
The weather grew colder, it was time to end our day at the zoo. So many memories were made there. We are going to spend the rest of the week there since it's close to home, too. Thank you for sharing your memories!

Thank goodness you found this! I've been on the lookout for the black one.
I notice that your friend hasn't posted a request, maybe there's some other reason that makes him hesitant, like being married?  I don't know what the answer is, but I think you should probably try anyway. Don't let him get away like that!

Uncle Vernon ripped open a cake shaped like a heart, and said that he wanted it to be a surprise. The whole family got up in a huff! After all this effort, he got a bad gift.
In the back of my mind is that I still have to work all the years I'm not able to go out.  If my career has any kind of upward mobility, I'll be out all that time and my daughter will be able to visit me for a few

Harry could hear the voice on the other end of the phone and he almost dropped his phone on its charger. “What’s up?” he said looking up at the man who was speaking.
There were no books when i was a kid, because my mom was really tired (and poor) and was afraid that my brother would read all the books because they were so awesome. I didn't have the money for toys, games and the radio. So we didn

Where are you going/what are you looking for?
Perhaps deciding that all the things we are working on at once are not all equally interesting, which can lead us to a kind of 'unfinished business' feeling. You can be working on a project that you are intensely interested in - like game development - and work on
She cackled loudly and then dropped out of view.  *Shit, I've lost this fight already.*  /u/gallowboob
Not unlike yourself and your brother. I don't want to seem insensitive but it really seems that you had a choice. Your brother was your best friend, and now you're just a piece of shit human being that doesn't even want him in your life. I hope

The reason Albus never has any real female friends (not even a good one) is probably to save the boys feelings.  It would be hard to be a boy, be nice to someone you're not interested in, and feel bad about it.
Weve heard said Hagrid was there when the war was declared and he couldve been at Hogwarts as a teacher. It doesnt mean he couldve been in class at the same time as any students (only 1 at a time) and still teach them the spells.

Theres some connection but I think you'll be fine, people will just point to your face if they think youre not paying attention. I know a few who have this problem, but don't make it a habit
Stunned one of the most powerful individuals on the face of the planet for a few hours isn't going to do a lot in the grand scheme of things.   Also, how many of the people who've been protesting Trump really want him to lose? I'm not
They joined the stream and played games against each other.  The whole time one of them was saying this was boring.  And now that they are playing against each other they are bored by it all.  So yeah, i am not feeling this at all.
As Fred and George said, the big difference is that *Grave Encounters* isn't a sci-fi.  I'd be very surprised if the movie makers didn't make reference to that fact.

Harry smoothed out the fabric of his robe and pulled off his sword.

Moving away from the old “it’s ok to get mad” advice that so many people still get, and the idea that you should never feel embarrassed about anger is the biggest thing that helped me. It’s not ok to lose it at

As Bathilda fumbled with his wand, the muggle world passed underneath him as he flew through a small forest. He had no wish to see London at all; it seemed a rather gloomy place to him.
Harry dodged the Smelting Pot, he was also in Gringotts during the time of Goblet of Fire when the wizarding world was going mad. He would have been more exposed to it that he should have been. That aside, Voldemort didn't want him to

Dust swirled around Harry, and it made the air around the castle eerily silent.

Oh you know Quirrell. You're probably like the 4th person I've read of his on this sub. He's a bit boring. I like the idea though.
His schoolbooks were very well illustrated and well written. I would recommend them to any student interested in literature. I don't think that any of us can forget what they accomplished. My only qualm is I don't feel like he was well liked by his schoolmates,

Harry you arent supposed to hit her  Harry you aren't supposed to get angry  Harry, stop it
Hagrid could be seen as one of the good guys, because he is willing to give up his life for the safety of others in case of a fire or a storm or something like that. You could say that he sacrificed himself for other's sake.
Tall dilapidated houses looked like war memorials against the backdrop of a sea of white.
But he couldntdo it. It was too dangerous!

Goblins silver repels mundane attacks better than silver, but has a lower DC than steel.  For this reason, I prefer to make copper out of silver if you have it available.   Steel is usually used for armor, or for weapons with piercing and slashing damage.
raised voices panted Mrs. Parker's name, her eyes darted back and forth between the woman and their child.
Harry wondered whether it was going to be worth seeing the last of the gang. “Is this a good time to say goodbye?” he asked.

No deaths he added.

As Dumbledore had told James once, "Be proud." I think that Dumbledore's words are quite fitting with how all of us feel about the ending. It does feel right, and quite satisfying to be on this journey with Harry Potter. It is bittersweet, though,

Dudley stopped pretending to be interested in her when they broke up for good.  Now she's trying to get back into his life, but the problem is her own mind.
Hermione Hmm She was always trying to push her way in my group. But she wasn't that bad. Now she's on a different team from me she's annoying af. Hermione is a great person
Lets get undercover before this guy.  If this really is a guy trying to do bad things to the sub, do your job, be in the background and have a buddy take a picture with you and put it on your instagram account.
She too waswearing a hat, and that must be a huge coincidence.
Theycrowded in standing rather than seating. That's my only concern with those seats

But Aberforth always talked a good game, and we did have some great shows and players!   You didn't hear about all the "bad apples" in the crowd though.    So many times I have seen it, but not so many times do you
Its okay he called you cute irl so its all good
How are we going to explain to her how that feels
Lets go and have a beer or two
Youve got some nerve asking us about your depression.
Over and over again.   For example, if I take the risk, I'm going to lose.
Her dark hair was as black as night.
Morning Albert said a few days ago that a lot of people were being denied entry and that's what you get when you make them look like criminals and treat their actions as such.   "If you look like a criminal you're probably a criminal."   You
All anyone knows is that he's gonna have some sort of role on AoS, but nothing on when or where yet.
The petried Muggleborns brought two or three muggle children out with them. They were of mixed ages but were in their late teens at the time. They had large, round brown eyes that were deep and almond shaped and were set in rather wide, straight faces that seemed to
Too weak to carry a kid.  Too strong to carry a child.
Well go straight down the left side. The top part of the side that says "Tours" has a bunch of information about the area and is where the tour guide is.
YouKnowWho was one. He is not on any teams and has not played in nearly a year.
I wonder why nobodys mentioned a problem with the app (not loading videos, etc).  It's my go-to to watch shows with audio, but I've not used it in a week or so.   It used to be pretty reliable (never had a
You know why Im so fucking pissed. Not one fucking fucking cent has been given to me. No fucking response to a single text or email, fuck it Im out, no fucking response to my fucking Facebook post either. I didnt fucking say fuck it Ill just pay you
Had Lupin forgiven him and saved him from death?
Everyone stand by abroomstick. I got banned from another subreddit for disagreeing with them and this is the same bullshit.
Still its cool said the people on reddit
Hows yer brother Charlie been after the move?
Better get the cloak...
That does not make any sense to me, unless you mean the one in the basement. I have never heard anyone mention the basement as an option
He smoothed it out. I think he should have been a bit more honest, though.
Then he pushed himself to his knees and pulled himself up so quickly, he didn't really even feel it. He let himself lean backwards again, his knees shaking slightly from the fall. He rolled over onto his back and slowly sat up slowly, his hands at his hips
This time she did not want to go to the mall.
The twins were back.Listen to them talk, it’s a full hour of pure entertainment.
Theyre all about Voldemort.  Harry, Ron, and Harry are all named after him and the book series.     Snape is pretty different, but he's a good guy in his own right.     Dumbledore gets more recognition because he's one
Dad and Lupinve both have a pretty bad taste in the mouth when it comes to mecha.
If Gryffindor won they would have to put everyone up.
He led a party. It wasnt a public place
In the middle of the night we woke to find the baby in the middle of the floor.  He was just sitting there all bloody and with all his teeth and gums missing and some of his clothes were gone and blood all over the place.  Our first reaction
Like it he said, the media isn't the problem.   The real problem is in our society which has an issue with not understanding that "everyone is born into a certain environment and does what they need to do to survive. "    If we all
My mother was friendly with the guy who wrote the screenplay for The Lord of the Rings.  He used to hang out with them at some point.  He's a nice guy, and it's really cool to see him get this opportunity to see his screenplay being brought
Muggleborn eh asked the same question and was downvoted to hell.   I think it's because Hermione is very loyal and has been to her friends during their darkest hour. Snape is just an asshole and doesn't have any empathy, especially towards muggleborns
he wont pay for anything else and just goes on and on about all the good things he did me.  we're both 25 and i think we're at the point where we're happy that we've found each other.  there is an entire year of marriage that
The Wedding Yes my friends, is to be the one that I have waited for my whole life to share with.
Or at least they should get in for free.
She sometimes flew in the same helicopter on her first day of work with a close friend. That would be great if she had a few years of experience flying, but she did just a few days and is already scared to do it again
Using a repulsed Hermione, the question was "When is your birthday?"
I just hoped you weren't going to tell me that there was nothing to worry about.
Hagrid Hagrid rolled up his sleeves, put on some gloves, then started cutting.
Oh Harry she said, you're so lucky.
It was strange to start the series against Scotland. We haven’t played them much in the last ten years and they are such a different team now to the one that won the Six Nations in 2003. Scotland had beaten France a few times since and a number of
But Harry was not a virgin. He had married Ron so they wouldn’t have to continue living like slaves. He also had two daughters from his first marriage. So, he would definitely have been married. But, he never married Ginny, nor did he even
Everyone pick their favorite and tell me your reasons.
Maybe she wastaking him to the hospital for stitches.
He seemed a charming and hardworking man who had a great reputation, was popular with colleagues and students, and had taken part in many of the company’s fundraising events.
There were many pictures of them at the game and I know I didn't see their shirt that day.  But they were still sitting in their seats and not up front where the pictures were taken.  Not that hard to believe I guess.
Harry would have screamed at him.    Harry would be dead.
But it was not, as some have said. It was not.
A werewolf Harry suggested.  *He had nothing against the werewolves.*
Peeves stuck out his tongue.
Its a Remembrall he has been talking about this in his videos, he has said that the whole idea behind it is that its a reminder of all of his accomplishments. It isn't supposed to be a big gift that hes going to give to her or anything. He wanted
He threw a dirty shot to the head of a defenseless person for a hit?
Forget I said it: He was awesome. One of the coolest guys, and I'm sure he'll do well as one of the hosts.  I just wish he had done more than one episode. I can't imagine he ever planned to stick around.
He never had much to do with it, it's just not a great system. It doesn't matter if you're scoring 30 points per game when you're not getting the benefit of a full back court to work with in the end.
Hello Harry she said. I don’t believe that for a second. I looked at her and smiled. I was looking for her but I thought she was just having lunch with a friend. She was dressed casually, she wasn’t going to a formal dinner
ttto come Dudley yelled out "you are the only one with the powers to kill him!" while attacking.  I thought it was hilarious, but I've only seen it once
I neednt have learned anything
I think Moms got a new best friend in you 😉
Nine and threequarters pipedreams.  I know you have those, but those aren't good examples...
It was Hermione who told them they had a sister.
We talked ourselves into a good showing today. If we don't play our best tomorrow I will be seriously concerned.  I can't believe how many goals we've conceded over the past 2 seasons. It's just insane. I'm not even sure if this is an
Everywhere else is full. Youre not an outlier. People have been complaining about it for years.
Hermione who came back in the first movie, in which Snape was a major antagonist.
Hagrid reached out a good foot to touch it. "I was only trying to play fair."  Ginny rolled her eyes at him. "Auntie Ginny has some of her own 'fairness' to play around with. I'm sure I'll be hearing a
Harry lit a lamp, and the air exploded with tiny birds and bugs, which exploded and filled Harry’s entire bedroom with the scent of blossoms.
The marquee was nearly empty inside the arena, a sign that no matter what happened in the game, the Red Wings will not be the center of attention Sunday afternoon at the United Center.
They hadnt even reached that level of bullshit yet
Everyone knows yourethe only one here...
Horrorstruck Harry waved madly at the monster and then ran in the opposite direction of the beast with a huff, though he'd been warned of its presence.
They waded deeper and deeper into the pool.
It was an unpleasant surprise when I opened this, but I think the next two days are going to be better than the last few days.  I'm getting that "I don't have a headache" feeling today, and it's been days since that was true.
And thats where...Mr. Ollivander lives.
Xenophilius set aside his usual arrogance of his race and looked into the eyes of a fellow Xenophilius and saw a fellow Xenophilius.
Reaching Snape she crouched forward and lifted his head to hers.
However these brothers were all Christians (according to the story, that is)
Maybe they wont know what to look for in the end.
Why exactly did Aberforth lose his shit when Skellige had a chance to get their ass handed to them by Jinteki?   Because he lost his cool.
This was part of a series of events around the time of the 9/11 attacks.
Professor Quirrell did not need an interpreter.
Dont worry the Weasleys will just use the money to buy up all the land, build a big castle, etc.  They will never own the island of Muggles, we all know that.
Nobody but those who already have the games will have access.  If you really want to get some content in, buy it off the eshop.
And she pulled out the fucking dagger. It's like in the dark souls universe, you stab someone from 2 feet away with a dagger and they pull out that fucking dagger. She could have killed him with a single swing of the bat.
Oh Mom can I have some money for dinner and maybe ice cream too? I'll make myself look so fucking great for my mother!
As he drove toward his home in suburban Chicago, a police SUV tailing him sped off down a road, flashing its lights. The officer behind him saw it and pulled out his gun, and a man began firing shots from his pistol at point-blank range.
Were gonna try an online tournament so we don't have to go out of state. If you are still looking for people let me know and we can do the same thing.
Hope your business goes well and I hope it's not your last.
Ill get yer an' that
Hes lost too much weight to be healthy
Its on my ticket.Barking out loud.
Ron youve got something that would interest me for the future. A website/blog that will feature your musings/writings and link back to yours.
As they jostled their way through the throng, they couldn't help noticing that in every eye there was a look of worry or fear, a hint of fear and horror. The little girl with her blue teddy bear had been on top of the tallest one, her
Harry breathed in the scent of the warm air as he walked through the crowd. He was so grateful to have such a large group here. If the people did not come as a group, then he did not consider it a success. He didn't believe that they would
You do it then, not us
When they arrived in London in the summer of 2018, there was no place on Earth they'd rather have been than a football ground.
Madam Hooch gave a lot of fucks about her children.
Ive found him he has a great gun and you can get good streaks like a streak with rockets, missiles etc
Then he climbed onto top of it and started shooting into the ceiling with the blaster.  Not to be outdone, the second Ewok was shooting into the air with it's own blaster.
She raised her wand! She raised her wand!  It is not good, for when I was young my father told me that "You see, when you use a wand, it makes a loud noise."  And I was only 8 at the time.  Then
His heart was pounding and he felt dizzy all he knew was he had been caught.
Professor Quirrell said Hagrid. If Voldemort had actually been real, I think he would be a good choice for an owl. His ability to control people is not uncommon for a child.
Then Hermione had performed a second charm on Neville, and was not surprised to discover he was as excited as her to be free of his mother's spell.
Bathilda drops in most of the maps for sure, the only maps that should stay are the first two, that way you can choose which one you get.
He flew in circles above the stadium before eventually crashing into a concrete pillar.   What a legend
Georges ngers groped at his home in the Sibir region, according to the interior ministry
It was old and he didn't have that much to say. So I moved on.
There is said Harry Potter book that's set in the same universe but takes place in the modern day.
Chapter Because Snitches have Right
The giant sat back down and said "You're right, but it's already too late to change it now."
Alas the first thing I can think of is a "Mermaids Island".  As a kid I thought it was like an island in the ocean and there were mermaids living there with a zoo or something.  I was so young I thought they were
Its your family course. If you aren't feeling it then go and spend your money on something else. Don't expect any sympathy
Harry I think its a sign that your time has come
Dont say that dont say that!
Anyway hes going to be replaced next year I hope... He seems a bit too eager to get rid of his team when he first arrives.            I love what he's doing to the league and it's good to see
Fletcher knows how to push his luck
Everyone expects me to be this person, because I'm so much of a social butterfly. And if I'm not that way, I'm also someone who is overly self-conscious about my body and how I look. You get to a certain point and when you look
In the very heart of the bustling city of Johannesburg lies the Johannesburg International Book Fair & Bookshop. Situated in the heart of the city, right next to an international airport and just around the corner from the city's bus station is a shop filled with books
Shortly before lunch Mrs. Smith returned, and she had nothing to say to her friend. The girl was too busy; and so she sat down, and listened with an expression of sad but intense attention to the story of the great adventure which had taken place on the afternoon before
Neville clutched the sleeve of his shirt as he stared at his hands, an inky blue. The gloves still clung to the ball in his outstretched palm. He'd made some strides this morning, but this was a bigger test. He'd made a handful of
A sudden slamming and scratching on the door startled me from my slumber. It was getting late, and my daughter wasn’t very awake yet.
Next moment he had a death wish, he has to eat the damn apple.
Come along then said Mr. E, my only fear is that this time there's no stopping me.
You asked me to write something about a couple months ago. I thought I had but when I looked at my notes from then I realized that I had never written it down. I thought of you today as I was cleaning out the back room. I took a quick glance
Hardly any wizards believed he was alive. They thought he died when he died.  The only one who knew he was alive was his son.
No news about MadEye, that's why the price is sky-high...
Hagrid said Hermione how old she was in order for her to get her parents approval to take her wand in school. Her parents didn't think Hermione was old enough to have a wand in school.
He was very glad that he had been spared any danger.  His voice sounded hoarse, but he was quite clear.   "And now I must turn your attention to the question that I had set myself," he began.
Gloomy and oppressive though it is, that's how these things go for most cultures. They are just trying to maintain social structure and maintain certain power over the people. The same thing that will lead to their downfall. That's what they are.
Pausing only to employ a "wiggle-jiggle" attack, then immediately returning to using all of his attacks is very... uhm... odd. I'm sure it's an intelligent way to utilize some of his strengths but it feels kind of wrong.
You kept saying Gregorovitch. What are you referring to?
Hermione was watching Ron through the window. His dark hair hung in his eyes, like the thick, grey curls that had been part of his hair for over a decade. She'd never seen his dark eyes, but it didn't matter as he'd probably be the only
Well we cant stay here and watch a deadman.  So I would just like to say what a great story this would have been.
But I must say, the reason I did the survey is because I have had the same problem but as I have learned, I can't blame the guy, he just isn't that into me.
It had sensed the moment the moment before they entered the store, it was the first sign, the first clue to the moment of destruction to come. It had been standing in the front of the store, watching the two women go in. It hadn't said a word
Well never be here again as I don't use social media anymore and I don't want to waste time to delete it again. But you could try and ask to talk to someone. In my case (I am in America) I would talk to my mom and have
Before he had time to look through the binoculars again, a massive shadow crossed his vision, causing him to duck his head back behind the thick bush.
I know Harry shouted.  Edit:  Just to clarify, it's just something he's said throughout the series, not a constant thing.  Also, he's not really shouting.  I think he's making fun of the characters.
Oh it was nothing, was just a friend that was visiting for a week.  I don't think anyone was really mad.
The doorbell rang. "Go away." He told the person to wait at the door for a second. "What did you expect?"
Which is what asked me to buy it in the first place.  I don't want to pay for a game that was not worth $15.
She kissed Percy on the forehead, then kissed him on the chin, then kissed his cheek, then kissed his lips.   She kissed him on the cheek, then kissed him on the lips again, then kissed his cheek, then kissed his lip again.
The Death Eaters got a new addition yesterday. A new employee in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, directed by a former director from Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince: Rupert Sanders.
Thats mental we havent even got the chance to try a lot of things. This is a good move. Lets not let one bad player ruin our season before even trying the new stuff. It will still be rough but we'll have more time to develop and plan.
He swooped like a hawk, took a look around then, without missing a beat, dived deep into the sand, into the surfline, the surf, the surfline, the beach, the surf, then out from between the cracks, between the boulders,
Reckon they know were going to lose the FA cup? Or just trying to keep it as tight as possible with a possible play-off place (they are second right?)
Attendance is now compulsory in high schools and universities, after the Ministry of Education last month raised the issue from July this year.
You know whateveryones saying. Just because the community is bad with this game, doesnt mean its bad on the level that it is.   I have over 500h in the game, dont even need to say how long it takes to get decent at this game (though
Hagrid helped Harry on the run though. If Harry was an innocent kid the Hagrid could be seen as not so bad
Stunned Dawlish and nicked two tries from the boot of Joe Simpson as they brushed aside Plymouth at Cuckmere Park.
Four students out of five admitted to hospital after swallowing poisonous snake venom
Again Dudley appeared to be on a roll with his form, yet again scoring on a penalty in the first half.
Here he goes Ron Paul, again. It would be nice to see an adult take the high road, but it appears as though he is more interested in embarrassing the candidate he is running against.
Harry felt in the wrong, though he knew he had no responsibility - that was his mother's job.
These are the Wrackspurt-Hudson area's best restaurants in 2020
Could Dum bledore have been the one that created/destroyed the prison?
Sent owls off teraflops
Reckon Dumbledores the only one not to have been touched by Harry.  (Unless Riddle was counting Dumbledores memories?)
Ginny cleared her throat and her body shook off the last few years of her life.
The last enemy that I encountered was a small group of pirates that I had to defeat with a cannon. I decided to use the cannon to hit them on their ship, which also had cannons mounted on it, but it just started firing randomly and hit my ship, damaging
It would have been better if you could use a real phone for those calls, the battery just drains so fast when it's off.
Higher and higher they fall. No way they're getting back in the top 10
See Harry whispered.I cant believe they werent able to come up with that...
She nodded slowly solemnly. "I'm sure I'm not the only one who saw it coming. I'm still surprised I made it through last time."
Kreacher rocked still faster than a locomotive
No I think youre pretty much spot on. The only thing i would suggest is maybe adding a little black liner to frame your eyes more but i think your eyes are perfect otherwise.
I think they should have a good idea of what they're doing before they do it.
Going to be any good?
Harry piled hisplate with the leftover food from his feast with Ginny and Ron, and he ate the entire plate without a spoon. He then sat down on a bench and rested, he was feeling tired already, but he wanted to spend as much time with Harry as possible.
They finally managed to hit the nail on the head for me.  You know, how sometimes you have to force yourself to drink your own piss because it tastes so nice?  Well, that's what makes these stories so good.  It's almost a rite of
If you would please, could you take a look at my post and give me your feedback?
I wont let you get hurt like this man, you'll go to the hospital man!
If I get one, I'm going to be on a mission to make it my first watch.
stand aside now. what do we do?
It was easier than I imagined. The fact that I didn't have to deal with a long line of people trying to get a "first class" seat also helped. I went with a large group so that I could split the check, and I just got a row
Somebody inside the church. My dad had a heart attack so I know a little bit about funerals
Harrys dreams were confused... but I'm pretty sure Harrys head is just a giant eyeball stuck in his neck...  *(it's the Harrys! He's dreaming!)*
He would have been crucified in public today.
All Ive had since day 1 is a few good eggs. All I can say is that theres no way I'd be grinding out all of the daily missions so fast as I did in D1 if I was a solo player. The rewards werent even that good
It was lucky that the game was over that way. Even the most casual of hockey fans would be impressed with a scoreless game.  I thought a 6-1 scoreline was the worst scoreline possible.
As Hermione and the other girls were making love to each other, Harry entered the room. Hermione had been wearing a short, tight leather miniskirt and her panties, which was much more revealing. She was rubbing herself vigorously. Harry was wearing a leather coat over a
Whats wrong said Fred?
Ron you come at me, you best not miss!   But I'm glad it's a good one - it's one I've been following for quite a while, and I like that it hasn't devolved into an anti-Ron Paul circlejerk.
He gave the oce server back to Riot for a month iirc.   And he even apologized if he made a mistake. That's a lot for a streamer.
Late in the afternoon I noticed there was a change in the price of Bitcoin, but no one on the forum was really saying anything about it. After a quick search, I found the news on a blog post from an anonymous source, stating that Bitcoin has finally been priced
Yes thank you what other options are there other than a new phone and a new charger/usb adapter?
Yeah why tell the player. All you have to do is give them some kind of item they get out of the way.
True I havent introduced my friends to rdr2 yet but they would all agree that the game isnt what they were expecting it to be
Someone in the crowd said it was a bad call. I heard it said the announcers think it was a good call though.
He hadnt been lying before and he wasnt lying now?  I dont believe you.  I believe that you're a liar.  Why the fuck would you call him liar when he wasn't lying?  You're just as bad as he is if not worse
Harry managed not to laugh at this one.
The more he recalled all this, the more he started to worry that something might have happened to him.
But I heard you need a license...for that.
They had practical exams in 3rd grade.
Hes a wandmaker I think. He did a series called 'What do I do with this wand' with his wife a while ago, and a few other things on her channel.
The larger of the two is actually a much heavier version of the smaller one. The scale should be adjusted accordingly.
For a split second i thought it was a new series  /r/marihime
He stowed the Cloak Of Transcendence, and then had to make the decision to use that Cloak again because of the new buff. It’s not as good as before, but it’s still pretty great.  Also, he had to go and
Im warning you Malfoy you are not that nice and your not a nice person.  You're not allowed to play.
Will you look at a deal on the game you are wanting. I have a list and price for some games. I am trying to sell all of them to help fund my next purchase. I will check my list again but i might be able to get you a list
It filled the whole room with a lovely blue light.
You should have said "I need to speak to the manager."  They can't fire him because of the contract he signed, it would be the same thing you did when you were at your previous place of employment.  They can give him some disciplinary action, but
Naturally with the Elder Scrolls being made by Bethesda and having many references to that series that makes sense. However for the past several years, I've had a growing sense of disbelief when they've made a reference or reference in a game that I haven't played in years,
But she stillwont leave me alone!
Written in narrow loopy script which I presume is a mix of Japanese and English, it looks like a Japanese calligraphy.
But in you know.... a real life game, when someone has been shot, you can run in to help them, but here you can’t do anything
Well thats it then...we're just gonna close down this thread.
Just before the holidays the Federal Reserve unexpectedly hiked its benchmark interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point to a range of 0 to 0.25 per cent.
The train began to pick up speed and moved forward a few meters.
I never expected this from him, but I think that's why he got off. He was a pretty big dick and he deserved to get kicked out.
Ive been packing for 5 days. The day before, i was on a 30g bag. I havent felt a change in how i feel. Maybe because i was feeling the effects, and then after, i wasnt. I would recommend a 10g for 2
Let me speak to the man who plays the other side.
What would you know about the "wounded" man? I believe that in that video he had a bandage over his knee.
When they told him to leave.
We call her Norberta. It's from a movie about a guy who keeps a little robot puppy that he names Norberta that constantly calls him and is like a little love letter to him. So sweet.
Ten minutes later they went into a big fight.
A great silver cross on a great red shirt. A great silver cross on a great red shirt.
Give us time to decide on who we want to vote for. We are still learning which party represents us best.
Bill and Charlie have a good, fun time playing a new game, then Charlie loses all his money because they're both bad at it.

Theywere the only things that brought any amount of enjoyment to my day and night. I am not a religious person, but I loved all of their music. I feel like they are being taken out of context and that people are trying to twist my words to fit into their
And Master Regulus had the best support out of the three. So it's true, it was because of them he was able to lead the rebellion.
She was rubbing at it on top of her face and it would burn her eyes and she got scared
Harry could feel fear as he saw his mother's body on a gurney, as well as the moment she said her final goodbye to him and walked away.
He heard Hermiones scream so loud that he came back.
Harry supposed that meant the woman he loved was also a witch or a vampire.
Anyone interested in playing a team of just me and my boyfriend (he's in the Air Force) to make a tourney out of a couple of our favorite games? We'd love to have you.
Snapes a Hogwarts teacher!

Harry woke at five o'clock to find himself in the middle of a crowd of people in a town called “Vancouver”. A small town in British Columbia which was the main destination for many of his classmates who had to get into college for a semester
Ron was fascinated by the world around him and had an uncanny ability to get to the heart of what was going on in any situation.
The oor trembled there. "How could it be so? This is the second time I have heard it, and both times, I felt it, too, when it rumbled."
He was spreadeagled on his knee,
He waited until he saw you to go and see his daughter?  Man, you guys suck.
She said she was trying to be more like her dad. Then she went out and tried to be just like him. It's just sad.

Itseems only yesterday shewas the object of controversy when shewas seen in a revealing top while shopping in Dublin with her new boyfriend.
The air became colder, and in its stead came the cry of a dog, a fierce and desperate whine, as it was dragged along the path to the edge of the meadow.
Before he could mention the name of this particular company, I was ready to find a new job
Not arguing I hope!  However this is one of the few times I actually think it will go through.
I mean I cant really tell what the problem is exactly. But if the answer is “my internet speed sucks” then I suggest a new router, or if you have one, you can disable or change the SSID for the modem in settings
What goods that terraforming would create and that the terraforming of earth could have happened to in the distant past of earth's existence.
I wondered whether IdrA would pick up Destiny and give him a game he can't fuck up in. He's so much better than him and even though it'd be a stomp in his favour I don't think destiny would get over his ego and just shit on
Never once in six years has anybody come to my door for donations.
Harry put the plates and glassware in the washing machine and turned on the power. The dishes were still in the sink when he finished, and the clothes were hanging in the closet. He had a headache. He was having a headache. It was probably the headaches that

maybe he just wanted to play with you. I know a guy who's only friend had a gf and he asked me to help him find someone to play with
He drank the last one in his beer bottle last time he was here, so I can only assume this is the last one for the night and everyone's already fucked.
Wow Ron sighed as he walked in to the room he had been hiding in since the attack on the train station. He noticed his brother was awake but then again, the only people he was really concerned for were his wife and her unborn baby. He heard the commotion
Her face was completely different during the video, but at first I thought it might be a new makeup look! Still looks awesome though.
Percy nearly broke his legs trying to move away from the water. He has a scar across his lower back from it.

The rain was pounding the earth, the wind was whipping the snow, everything was wet in the stormy night when I woke up.
You never get anything out of it if you don't keep at it. So you have no choice but to keep at it.
Dyou think he meant "we" as in all humans, not just you? I think it's pretty clear what he meant, you didn't answer his question.
Hagrid however was on a secret mission with Snape. He could not tell anyone about the mission, not even his parents. I don't recall if he went alone or with Snape and/or if he was killed at the end of the book or not.
Food is one of the main reasons that we have so much problems these days. It's such an easy thing to get addicted to in our society. Thats why people turn to food, but why do we take a drug that takes time to get addicted to and make

Hermione shuddered and took a step forward, her hair streaming down her face. "You…you’re a horcrux?"
Dung panicked I heard the noise again.
As well as anyone who's a fan of the game, would anyone happen to know if this is a new patch? It's available in the Steam store now for a few hours (UK), but seems to be unavailable for preorder yet.
He bent and pulled her closer, kissing and kissing until her hands were on his shoulders, his hands on her shoulders, her head on his chest, his body on hers, their bodies entwined.

However recent events must serve as a wake-up call to the powers that be.
I am ashamed to say that I am part of the problem.
Give that here Malfoy, now you are going to look stupid. And if they still think this is an interesting thing I will come and kick your ass and make you learn the value of knowledge. You have been warned, you rat bastard Malfoy. You have been warned.
An whatre you lot talkin about?
You think this is bad? Try being a girl in a fraternity at a large public school in the northeast with about 30 guys in your class. No one has a social life, you're all completely alone and feel like shit pretty often. The only way to make yourself
Sign said Harry looking to play striker? Sign is wrong. Harry said he was happy to play wherever the team needs.
Flint nearly kills the water supply, how you think they got it back on?

At once their features are not exactly the same, though there's a lot of resemblance.
He rammed it into the door at the back of the van then slammed the car out of the way.
So Dirk Cresswell is gonna get paid millions of pounds to sit on the bench. That'll be nice.
Yeah me too. My exes all had issues.   I had sex on the side with a different woman and got an STD.
Bills always been decent at corner I would assume
The wound now looked infected. My mom had already tried the hot compress on it, and then tried pouring cold water over it. She had already used ice and water before that. I have no idea what it was that had caused it, though. It was almost too
It just makes me realize how much of their lives have been taken up by their fans.  What a sad life.
If Dudley was frightened by a black cat in the first one, he was never terrified by a black cat again.   You can't just scare yourself to death.
It had taken all my willpower not to tear up while reading her comment.  But it was worth it.
If youre going to do the test, make sure you have a good spot. Its going to be hot and youll be trying to breathe in as much air as you can before it gets hot and humid.   Other than that, just relax.   Your

This wasnt what youd call a great performance. But I dont really care about scoring points since I want us to win. But i think thats been a consistent issue for the defense this year
Their expressions of consternation are so amusing to me. Like, if you're upset, just act normally!
Now he was back in the saddle and his mother was gone.
Remembered that I am a very bad dancer, and that I think it would be fun to try to show off my moves with my family around!
Where am I repeated?
Yes I quite agree. I am curious where they come up with their numbers for these ratings? I always thought this was more of an American thing because we really need to get better about using our toilets. There are many instances of people urinating everywhere.
Its a famous place. There are lots of restaurants and stores in the surrounding area. It is a beautiful area.
Hes o with some real talent.
Yehve been singled out so many times since the game started I really cant be arsed to care anymore.
All the others are in the same category - they're good, but the real deal is The Godfather. I've actually seen all of them probably 2-3 times each over the years... but it's never going to be beaten.
Ron looked down at himself in the reflection of the mirror. He was covered in grease and was wearing a dirty dirty pair of shorts and a t-shirt. The smell was almost unbearable, and he felt a cold sweat starting to bead on his forehead.
Harry was even glad to be there for his first visit to Australia but the royal, 36, found himself in no hurry to leave once he and his wife Meghan Markle hit the first hurdle of getting visas.
Filch took them down!
After half an hour? Did he have to go for like a half an hour to the bathroom or something?
Well no Ron admitted. Also no way we will ever see him again
It seemed incredibly unlikely.
If so Id like the key please
Yes here we are. The beginning of the end of the golden days...
He helped Fred and Wilma make it through a tough childhood, and when he’s gone, they’ll be able to move on with their lives.  So, they’ll still have to face their former problems, the good and the bad
He added something under the heading "Lions of the Far East" on the front of the poster. He didn't know he was gonna be in the video, he only knew the title.
Your mother cant produce you for money, but you know her way around a camera.  I don't think there will be any competition in this area.
They took my Luna's Echo :(
Hekept his eyes fixed on his mobile, still in his PJ pants with his hair still pulled up into a ponytail.
So does it say in the notes that it will be released as part of a bundle with something else? I don’t see a “free” part or anything like that.
He picked up a red card and I can't remember if it was for dissent, for getting into the ref's face, or for the whole thing with his shirt. I can't remember.
They were all waving to him with the red flags and he took that as a challenge from the fans to start a fight?  This is why some fans are so shitty.
But see what the fuck do I know
Excuses alibis and wild stories. My cousin has a girlfriend that goes to every movie because the story revolves around her. She has the audacity to say it doesn't affect her at all.
Unless said Ron shes kinda a dick.
Uncle Vernon had parked the car outside of the church.
I beg you I don't play with many people, I've just joined this game like 2 days ago, how do I add friends. Also can I get the name of my clan too?

Something hot and wet to lick your feet :)
I agree I think it would be nice.   They could also implement an option for'show all matches' in the top left corner where you can sort by MMR, but I think this should be implemented as a separate option.
Youll be ggetting all 3 rewards at the same time.
He looked over his shoulder to see what he was shooting at
Well we know our new OC is good but what about the rest of the staff?
We make it ourselves.  We also make our own pasta sauce that is amazing.
Well meet you in the middle then I'll shoot to the moon
Look Harry heard one of the most incredible things, "Hey Harry you know you'll like the other guys too, you're not gay".
It gave the illusion that I didn't know who I was.
Shake your head all you want, that's what all of us are doing.
Now Harry understood why they called him the “Mighty Harry” and why his father and uncle had been called Harry the Elder. He had to look very strong and he had to be strong in front of everyone. There was no place for weakness in him.
When the doors opened we had to cross the road and walk towards the river to go through the front door. It felt like an eternity until we reached the front door and there was a huge line of people waiting to get in. So frustrating! They let us in but
It was too much work for a small team to take the effort to code. So they just stopped caring about it.  Maybe they'll redo it with the new version of it?
The Ministry of Magic and Fantastic Beasts are the only two things I’m actually really excited about for this year. And not just because of their high production values and cast, but because they are my two favourite things that can coexist as movies and also because they
They didnt tell him at the last interview to come to practice today or he would be fined. Not sure how to spin that as some sort of a move to force his way out. Not sure what the fuck they were thinking
Meanwhile the second brother is watching from his room above.
Trust him said Lupin. You can't trust the man.
They stood quite still until I turned my head and they had both closed their eyes. I still got a good look at the rest of their face, but I didn't know what else I could see.
Theyll think Ive told you to do a thing, but Ive no idea what it is and you'd need to tell me.

Inside were mounds of the plant matter the animals had consumed, but the researchers were also able to use that as a sample of pollen.
He watched her supposingly for a few minutes, but at last rose to his feet. Then, with a very sad air, and raising his hat a little in front of him, he walked off with a great smile on his face.
No wonder tempers ran high yesterday and they're all acting like a bunch of kids today
Having refused what I believe was inhumane treatment, I now look to a more enlightened country for a second chance.
Harry thoughtthis was strangely cute...
He retired several years ago.  Now that I have the money I can tell you that is an absolutely incredible rifle with some really crazy features in the stock for its day.
Snape had reinstated Umbridges parents
I wanted to come out and tell him that I loved him, but then I didn't want him to think that I wanted anything but him and I ended up running away to a different room before I could get it out of my mouth.
So youre not even going to tell us what it does exactly?

Hermione had now started to realize that, not only was her friend not answering her, that her friend had even moved on to the next subject. Hermione could feel that, with such obvious signs of a possible breakup, her friend was definitely losing interest in her.

Harry slipped into a more comfortable mode, which allowed him to relax into the warm embrace of the gentle caress of Emma's hands.
The cat didnt move. He/She knew whats going on.
Ron nodded his appreciation for the kind gesture, but was quickly reminded of his own family's recent troubles when the man reached out for help, and a moment later the whole room fell silent.
Harry you keep talking about the war being about religion
Ha ha said Hermione in a loud voice.          The whole class stared.             She giggled, then gave the boy a wink.

Hermione muttered Harry embarrassedly as she put her hand on his shoulder and leaned into his arms
He used to down vote everything and then i found out why. No one ever says anything if you’re a mod.
Thenhe noticed a grubby little boy about ten years old carrying a small but powerful-looking weapon of some sort on his back with a huge grin on his face.

CHAPTER FOURTEEN NORBERT THE BOSS OF THE CHEESEBURGER KING
After what seemed likehours of waiting, my boss asked me to come in to work this morning. I don't think I've ever worked so long in a week before. It was pretty depressing.
It now dawned on me that that was the "we're getting married" bit. I could've sworn that was the "we're getting married" bit, because I have heard it so often that I automatically assume that's what that means. I guess I'm missing
Hagrid Harry borrowed Rons wand to find the way.
His toy broomstick could have been a key to finding the killer
Tell him from me he seems a bit too nice for his own good.   This could have been his first encounter with a woman.  It was kind of hard to be direct about it, because I was still kind of in shock from the whole thing, but

But well take turns getting his cock sucked and I have to suck his dick at the same time. I could suck his dick all day. It will be so wet.
He knew why she was there, he just didn't care.  The fact that he just went up and started asking questions means his goal was to find out everything that happened.
Have you told Snape that you want to stay with him?
He forced the door open, and I stepped back to give a little room, just enough for the guard to squeeze by me with his shoulder in contact with my back. "What the-?" I was surprised to see my new roommate standing right beside me, in what

Ron gave a weak smile to the dark wizard and nodded to a group of goblins behind the dwarf who had entered.

Why would he have any need for them? He has a large and loyal fan base that will buy whatever he does. Even as bad as his last two albums were, that isn't going to change.
Ive said all along that i wanted him to stay.  But its clear he just wants a nice ring to reward his loyalty.  He wont do it for the money and he won't even go to his hometown.  He will just go to the highest bidder.
So the three of you decided to fuck him in the ass for a few hours? Or is this some other weird dude who wants to fuck you?
But as all they want is the money....so you're just making it all up?
I should have realised it was fake when he came off the bench at the end of a match on a day when he was injured.  He didn't say anything.
But by suggesting that some may have to pay more than others, the state-run media agency says it is not targeting any specific group.
Chapter Seeing the grave of the man who had made the voyage.
She gave him an ice pick. What a monster.

Never mind said Harry was not the best man, they still won. I love how they could make such a lame excuse to win.
But this is madlads
Shut it growled Moody. "I hate this damn planet" the purple beast was feeling the same way.
Something go wrong with the app?
Good thinking said Ron.
They had a cat with the same name a few weeks ago. No name though.  We've named them all. I'm not good with names.  I call my friend, "the guy with a cat" sometimes.
A magic beyond all imagining:
Madam Pomfrey came over with a new case that had just landed on her desk.
Arthur told me you were going to the game, and I told him he shouldn't bother.
Partly to change the perception about it as the guy who had it for a bit and gave it up for no good reason, but mostly because it was a really nice knife.

You dont believe it happens, but a new study in Sweden has found that women who have a positive attitude are more likely to have children later in life.
Harry pulled a wizarding sword from beneath his blouse, his arm wrapped around it for balance, and then he pushed his hands into his hair and pulled his fingers over his lips. "Just how much did you want this for?"
No two Ollivander wands are exactly alike: the same kind is made of precious metals. Some of them are crafted into magical wands, while others are used for enchantments or simply for personal use.

She had turned blonde in the last picture I saw.
Vy is she doing the "Dont mind me i'm just watching my own pee" meme?
Harry took it into his own hands when he realised there were only three hours left in the tourney. No-one could tell him what to do when that happened.
Uncle Vernon rapped the door with a hammer on his fist like a man in prison. He'd been locked inside for years.
Don you worry Harry. We know that the best way to protect our children is to put the government in charge.   ^^^/s
Harry would gladly have a normal life.

Spitting hair out of my nose and making my mother chase me around the house to chase it back out of my mouth.  It wasn't until I was a teen that I found out the reason for it. It's an earwig from the front yard I suppose.

He let the material loose but you didn’t
He asked him to come up with a way to save everyone, and all of a sudden the solution comes to him. That's why I assumed it was a joke. I don't think he'd give him that kind of response.
will we need to wait another three or so days until these appear in our store again?
The Lovegoods are quite an interesting family. I like their writing, but my dislike of their parenting comes through in the show.  "If he says he wants it then I'm not going to make him stop."
Harry saw Hermiones comprehension of magic as he said "it's a trick" "a stupid trick. you're better than that" and he said "you can't fool me"

I knew Ginny was a weiner before this episode.
Lets go downstairs theres a good spot we can chill.
He couldnt stop stammering.
Didnt the simple fact that he was shot by a fucking police officer stop this kind of story from getting traction?
People pushed their way into the gate as if they owned it? They had no right to be there. This is like the people of NYC invading the World Trade Center.
Harry read the words.

Harry Potter chorused the phrase "this is my first day of seventh year..."

Their teacher Madam Hoochim says that the girls were taught to do this before marriage and she encouraged them to follow suit.
He could easily have got in the endzone if his legs were in better shape.      He was too slow and his eyes were terrible.      Just an all around bad show.      That was disappointing for him
He chanced a glance over to the left, and saw a dark shape behind the small, squat figure. The man took a step forward, and then another, until he was right behind the boy. A single quick step, and he had the boy on the ground.

This struck Harry as so true. "A man could have his entire life, if one day he was born into this world, and this was all he could possibly want," he said. "It was just such a sad and profound thing to think about."

He paced up and down in front of me, and it wasn't for too long, but when I looked at him and he looked back, I realized I was in love.
The Dursleys did not have magical powers.
He wished he was a girl so he wouldn't have to wear those clothes, which may or may not be based on a fact.   A true gentleman is more than just looks.
Mrs. Dursley fell asleep under a busstop outside the Ministry of Magic in the wizarding city of Hogsmeade, and woke up with a headache.

If Snape gets hold of a horcrux then the deathly hallows will be in danger. However the prophecy is said to be fulfilled.
Snapes refereeing he spluttered.  "I was so nervous he was going to miss it..." he said, as he began to giggle uncontrollably.
I cant handle it. This looks amazing, you are doing this on a laptop with only 1gb of RAM
At this moment the market is not going to do much for the next few weeks. But I will keep an eye on it. I am pretty sure that most of my money is on Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum and NEO so I wont move it for a while.
Where there should have been water, there was an empty field, and one of the men was barefoot.
Butbut Reg said you need a good understanding of the game to use him as the best counter and now he’s been removed  Edit: sorry I was misinformed
The moment he had that look on his face and we realised "Oh shit" and he was just completely gone. He looked so scared and confused at the same time. Very eerie, I loved it
He had only just arrived at the school, but I recognised him straight away from the television he watched at his parent's home.
Oh Neville Im so sorry. I don't remember the details because I was so annoyed with the whole thing myself. But I will say that the only reason my family kept it alive with my parents was because my dad thought it would be good for me to be part of
Harry thought she was going to leave him, but she went on a journey to find herself and a way to stop the war before it got too far out of hand
Youd better stay inside for some time as I am about to pull out my wallet!  I'll be gone for the next few months to work on my own projects. I hope I have time.
Someone else might kill the first boss or 2 before your other team, so you have to come back to save them.  I wouldn't be that bothered if it just made sense.  But it does mean there's a very good chance you will not be able to
Little did Harry know...
Help he murmured but I could feel him turn away from me.
Xenophilius raised his eyebrows. His hand lifted and brought the sword’s scabbard to his chest. He’d never drawn a sword before, but he’d fought in wars and other battles. He’d won, though, and that meant
Recent research undertaken by The University of Manchester School of Medicine has identified how two factors in the brain can produce differences in patient outcomes following surgery.
Even assuming that she wants to take the child away, the state can still provide for the child. They would just need to agree to give up her guardianship.
Hermione lit her wand and pointed it towards Hermione Granger.
Because youre the one who said it?

Chapter Maybe I am missing something but I am struggling to understand the point of chapter 3. Maybe it is because of your typo, it appears that there are about 5 different chapters now. I do not think there are really enough to justify the time it will take to read
Andthen of course there was the guy who posted about how they were tired of women telling him how he should act.  Then there was the dude who made a very well thought out post explaining how to keep from getting raped when you're a guy.  I hate this
How is he Mrs. Simpson?
Was it likely that you would have lived anyway? In other words, if a woman had been the one who struck you with her purse, would she still have gotten what was she trying to do? Would the purse still be there?
Hed have loved to be a kid.  I bet he was a blast.
What funHe swooped suddenly into the night.
The idea was dreadful, but the execution was brilliant.
Hermione did a sort of double-take when she saw the man in the mask.
He was tall thin and athletic.
She Harry and Ron's dad. I don't think we'll see a full sized Harry Potter movie. But there is a chance for a miniseries or short film. The world needs more Harry Potter stories.
He does not forgive those who sin.  There are no absolutes in this life.
For a full minute, I just thought this was the same old song.
Looking pleased at the prospect of some new content but disappointed that the rest of the game is still empty.
The rock cakes were delicious!
I could come with you but I'm currently on holidays
They passed through the window without so much as blinking.
Go on Hermione. Let us know when it gets fixed, you lazy shit.
Quirrellshead looked strangely small for a minute there
We could all have gone to work together and made up. Then if we didn't like each other we didn't. Now you two can go back to being friends without all the drama.
Scrimgeour Ron and Hermione were just the same but with better hair.
He couldnt believe it. "She's beautiful."
Whatve you done to that poor girl's head?
She sighed deeply as she stood in the kitchen and made herself a drink. She did the dishes as well.
They stared at him.You would have thought that some of those guys could have picked up on that.Not being able to pick up on that should not be a problem.
Whats the problem asked? I think you should ask this if you're really interested in finding out.
Of course he vos gonna say this shit. I bet u a year ago that he wouldn't say anything like this. Now he wants the attention
The whole shack shivered and moved in sync with each other.
Let me think let me think, that was a great game to go out on! Great fight boys.
I think Ive seen this game before somewhere.
Ooh sticking up for the elderly! The most noble and purest of deeds!  > It really is amazing how a guy who got married the same day can end up with a girl that he's obviously never had any romantic feelings for, never had an attraction towards
Ginny did not seek help from her boyfriend when she realised he was in debt.
The idea made him chuckle. “Sure. That’s a cool idea.” But he couldn’t help wondering what had gotten into him. He didn’t know much about science, much less space. But in science they said  
Wowthats right I forgot about that...      My theory is that its a combination of the two. They are both incredibly well designed but when used together they actually produce some amazing effects. I mean a combination of the two together can be used to create an
Harry landed next to a little boy who had been carried by his mother, a pretty fair-skinned girl with light brown hair and hazel eyes. They were smiling at each other, looking back over at Harry. He smiled back at them, and felt an odd sense

So its true Sheamus is a dickhead and I'm not surprised about any thing he does.
Why panted Hermione hurrying toward Malfoy when it's possible to see her panting behind him?  Edit: I didn't realize she was actually running there.
Gringotts is no longer in the film, and Harry has taken a liking to Bellatrix since the first time he saw her.
His legs jammed into mine when I was sitting on the toilet
For some reason he reminds me of Chris Sale. Both are lefties and both throw high 90s fastball/slider/curveball. Only thing that makes him not look like a starter is that he doesn't have that 6'7" frame.
If he was honest, he would have told you. Maybe he wants to try something new (different kind of sex) with you. Be cautious, don't assume too much.   You might want to read the sidebar, there's a lot of info on the
As long as Mr. Bean doesn't mind, he could play The World's Greatest Detective.

The door opened A small red light blinked On her bedside table It was not the alarm clock The small red light blinked Her eyes blinked slowly She did not stir. She was on her stomach She did not have a pulse She did not breathe There was a long pause Then
We know the snakes. We’ve even got names for them all: “crocodile”, “boa”, “giant” and more.
Time to sit down with my friend and go into a corner and play for a while.
I was sure you were gonna do all your combos on her as well.    Also this clip is old as fuck.
They had indeed been to a lot of places.
Why wouldnt he have been called a legend?
You are Mary Elizabeth Winstead. You are also the sister of the actress Kate Mara who is also pretty, but she has blonde hair.   So what's the catch? If she is in The Martian, that's the one you should watch.

Borgin and Burke were already announced by Fox Sports, who are a few months behind but already picked up Fabbri.  There was also the rumor a few weeks ago that Gourde was on his way to Columbus.
she sobbed into his chest, "I'm not going to die."
Now paying attention to them, I have read some conflicting information about this. Are people saying "yes" or "no" or are people saying it depends on the person who is doing the test?   I would definitely do the test if I were you, unless

Absolutely pointless seeing as this has been tried for ages and has been disproved by the data.
Oliver Woodwill meet you, then.
Ah Hagrid the last hope for wizards to get out of the woods.
Hagrid lived in a forest with his friends Ron Weasley and Draco Malfoy. He had a brother, Fred, who he lived with but they were not close. Ron also had his brother Hermione but she was not the love of his life, she was a good friend, and
Its hard to stopMuggles because they are so well versed in magical things, if you let them get to you.
Its okay said Harry Styles.
Not only was Hagrid an extremely nice man but also he was the headmaster of a magic school. Imagine if that had any say in the matter.
Good idea said Ron Swanson
I shouldnta told yeh to go home, ya hear.
The last surface on the globe is covered with two layers of dust
He had sometimes thought of his cousin
Harry lay there lost in his own mind. He couldn't be certain the man's motives were right, but something about the man's face was familiar. When he looked at his face, a chill descended on him and he thought about the man. "Is that the
As soon as he's cleared of wrongdoing, there is no way in hell he resigns.
Oh of course not. I'm the exact opposite; most times, I think to myself 'why do I like this girl?'
I think the big one that you mention is the one with a bit of a lack of action (or action from the male characters). The two that come to my mind are The Last Exorcism and The Host.
There are still a few things that need to be worked on - such as the search function (it is currently not working for me), but I'm really excited about what this site is doing!
Sometimes he could not have been in such a good mood if you ask me.
It was one of those days that had you sitting with your head in your hands and wishing that time just stood still. One of those days that felt like it would never end and that time would never slow down.
Ours do know a little about the rain.
So were going to start banning and removing posts about things now because some people are going to whine about it?  Not a good sign for the state of this subreddit when it feels like the mods have little to no real power over content they see.
Harry was faster than ever at finding out and putting things right, and his love life was a lot less rocky.
In one night theyd be able to get in the bed and have sex, take pics, video, etc. and I'd still be in bed, not out of it
Those are the Deathly Hallows on the right hand side, right?
Of course we dont like these people, theyre from another continent that doesnt share our culture or religious beliefs
But Snape tried to help Malfoy and was told to be quiet. There may be a time where his advice was useless, but that does not make it wrong.
Harry climbed over it in the movie
Then on Harrys count I'd say the majority of these are wrong, but my personal favorite is "Bald eagles are bald eagles, and they are aggressive, and they have very, very long claws."
Lupins retort was last night. She looked like a goner, she was just so shocked, and she had to make sure that she had everything, because she didn’t want to leave her children. I’ve been in this business for a long time
When were looking for her do you mean in the anime or the manga? I’m not sure if she makes an appearance in both.   Though I do like your theory, I feel like it’d be too weird for someone to go into a
There were piles upon piles of old books.
Fallen Warrior Well said at home
Hagrid told that stranger that his mother died of syphilis and Harry believed it, because he was a very young child at the time (11 or 12?)

Fleur tells us you were "the only one" in the family who had done anything about the accident, and that you had to move.
As she removed Mafaldas dress, she would see a tiny cut, so it would be obvious, and she would know she was not wearing a top.
Slytherin Seeker Terence Higgs, first in line for coronavirus vaccine, dies from...
But its against our laws to sell alcohol to anyone under 21, so what's the problem?  Besides they were probably underage.
Lousy croaked Ron wincing at the thought of that!

Hagrid said you were under the weather, and he is quite literally under the weather as well.
Harry slid off his seat and pushed through the crowded office building as quietly as he could.
He lled it with the best weapon in the game, the Sledgehammer.
Leading them past several cities to a place I’ve only ever been before, then through the countryside, then through the desert again, then finally to a beach where I could get out of the hot sun.  Then I realized that it was raining as I was
My dad says it to me a lot, it's the worst when he says it and then when I say something back he says "awww you got a big family?"
Why had they fallen into their trap, and why had they been unable to fight back?

Their priority now had to do with making the DLC. This isn't their priority. This is what they are doing with the free DLC (maybe there will be paid DLC).
Who on earth wants to be around a guy in a pink t-shirt and shorts?
Turning the envelope over and seeing it was a real dollar bill surprised the hell out of me.
He saw what had happened to his father, when the world and the world's people had left his father behind and when he saw his family had all become a pile of ashes.
He said replied Dirk and Dirk replied "No. You have an important part here." The end.
Potter did she say that's why she asked if he was still a herm?
They all look like they want their own team.
I mean Ron was in a whole another league in the sense that no one in the show could match him in his physical capabilities.
He soon discovered it was too late. His hair had been cut short to save him from the ravages of shaving - his skin was dry and flaky, a dull gray by the time he'd finished.
Like Barty Crouch turned back to become one, or what?
Robes she said under her robe...

Youve made your point. Go ahead and downvote me, but I still wont listen to this band.
Well like I say, there are no rules in my store as long as it's not the wrong color or it's in a different part of the store. I only check if the card is the right size for that slot as I don't want to have to bend
I mean was inthebanned for cheating on the test not worth enough to have a permaban for even playing.
Hagrids always wanted a baby. She probably didn't want to have the pain, but in some sense she would have done it to herself if it meant she could be with her family.
It gave Harry a scar from where it was burned, so he is covered from it
So if I look at a single image, and have the context of it, I can take a guess what it might represent without actually doing that image or context-based interpretation?   What a wonderful world.
Shut up Ron snapped at him
If they emerged into the light.
They were pleased with the result, but they said it could have been a lot better.
He felt very strange.  He felt weird.  It wasn't normal for him.
Heheard Hermione whisper Its always sunny in Philadelphia.
That is because it was an exclusive. Not everyone will get a rare or legendary in the same pool of 10,000.

Well yeah he went from the best defender in the league to just another average defender.
Deciding that it was too hard to just sit on a toilet.   "The fuck, I just did it"

Hardly anyone had seen them.
Clearly not wanting to start a fight or argue. He's just a good boy.   He doesn't get why you don't want to go to the petting zoo and he doesn't blame you for that. He just doesn't understand why you're not talking
They reached Kings Cross this morning with no issues. In fact the train I was on this morning was delayed 45 minutes but when they got onto the track there were no delays.
Harry hadnt had a full year of experience in a full season at Liverpool when he was released, and has had several years of experience and training at Barcelona. He still played in the league and won the CL there, then went on a free transfer to the same club.
Withone last desperate look at her, I couldn't bring myself to turn my back on her as she walked toward the door, the last of her life passing before me.
Those of us who have kids and parents at the same time. Sometimes it's hard having to decide which is more important (food or phone call).
What is this Seal Team six stuff?  Edit: I meant to say, are you talking about like a Seal Team six, or did you actually shoot and kill a Seal in Iraq?
Neville was snoring loudly. He got up and got some water. "Morning." He stretched out his legs and yawned.
She shook her head, but then turned around and let out another scream. "My god... I'm so sorry!"
It was wrapped in bacon.  Why do people put their phones in a bag like that?
They made their way up here with their kids at a young age and have stayed ever since. They are still here, I'm so proud of them, so excited to see what the future holds for them. I'm thankful for all of my friends who gave me the

He was looking at my boobs in high school, and then he started touching my back.

You might have been in a team that won the league.   In one of those teams, you might have been the best player.   In another, you might have been the worst.   The best player was also the team’s greatest player
It was standing on your shoulders.  It was being dragged across your shoulders.  It was being stretched across your shoulders.  It was being held onto your shoulders.  It was the last straw to push your parents away.  It was the best reason to push
Descendo muttered Ron pointing his finger in the air and said “I told you to quit that crap! Now come on before I get in your face!”
He realized he must be playing a game if he doesn't see the hypocrisy.   So he started the game. And he became aware of what he had done.
Harry was embarrassed and ashamed.
Curiously it had not affected me... So I figured that something was wrong with my app...
Enough of this nonsense about a "no-no" and "stupid".  No one is stopping you from calling yourself what you want, and it isn't hurting anyone in any way.  Just because someone has a problem with your calling yourself a trans woman,
youve never seen Potter and the deathly hallows have you
He found a pair of dirty gloves! What a dick!
You sought to help and this is what happened. That's all. No judgement, only support. Don't hold onto your feelings of guilt, you didn't do anything wrong.
You wouldnt want to use that in the car, because it only takes about a second to fire. I'd recommend either an e-liquids or a regulated device for that.

The last shop was a pain in the ass for me. There's like nothing good in the game and there aren't any more that I know of that I can't get off the main game.
If its annoying you I guess but I find it interesting.  It's not like it would affect the quality of gameplay.
Your father on the right is definitely not impressed.
The third was handwritten.
Only the edge of the ring, that's it.

Potionslessons were turning into something like the movie Dredd except with different characters.  I was very, very disappointed.
Harry watched as she was released.
It was as though he had only heard a part of my explanation and was still trying to figure out what I was saying. Then he walked away and stared at the floor.
things she added in her speech:  - "the more people we get to see it, the more it's going to change people's perceptions"
However the change in my life has changed drastically.  Before I took this stuff, I was depressed.  I never got it up.  Now, I'm actually quite happy and feel more confident.  And now this helps!  I can't thank you enough

With Snapes track record I think Dumbledore will be a bit of an ass. Not saying that Snape isn't a good character. Dumbledore being a decent character makes the fact that he is a good one even worse.  Dumbledore has no redeeming qualities, nor a real goal
I reckon he might. I feel like if he doesn't come back I'll be so disappointed.   But I also really love this guy. I just want to see what he can do with more time.
Once he reached the end of the game I did a little research, and I was informed that you could only do a single charge, and it ended too quickly to do multiple charges on him.  So that kinda makes it worth it.

Professor McGonagall turned to the Gryffindors and said, “The Dark Lord has come to us and, as we saw before, he is no more to be trusted than we are. The only path to safety is for us to put an end to his tyranny
They did not dare show us any other gameplay for the game. Its still in beta. They will be showing much more at the game play video, but for now you have to wait for their official announcement tomorrow.
He put Harrys wand away, so he probably wasnt a fan anyway.
Well then you did it right
Wands only no contact. He probably has a bad memory but if he forgets the words "I love you" that means he likes you. He's just trying to show affection.
Cudgel his brains though his face. If his brain is hurting he will be more likely to open his wallet and give the police your license plate.   Just a thought...
Harry couldnt blame them. All he had to do was make sure they left.  Instead he had to tell a friend that they had to move. That's not something you do to a friend. Not only is it rude to the friend, but it's also going to

What a blow for him.  But I'm glad to see a team do that.  If they were to get the same deal, what would that mean to his confidence?  I don't really know, I guess it must suck.  But I'm glad
Im afraid that one of them will start to turn and run with him.
Dum bledore had left me alone before this. That’s enough to make me stop playing. I hate being attacked by these things with no consequence.
Wellwell nd a way out of that whole mess would be to have a proper and independent media outlet with more than one editor.
Come on boy its like 8 degrees Celsius outside
Everyone was looking at us in shock, it was really bizarre as we were literally the only ones walking in the forest with not a soul in sight, with a few other families of young children running around, so we thought they just decided to give us the eye for nothing

One simple movement and it becomes apparent.
This needs thinking about and if you find a good solution. Please PM me.  Edit: If you don't think this works, I will create a simple reddit app to do this, or just do it on my main PC.
Why asked Hermione and Ron if they liked her in the first place?
What if they lost interest and were just like, "Well, I guess I'll go back to using Tumblr or some shit that's not for me."?
Had to let that get away to save a little face.     Fucking dumb. It doesn't matter that you "wanted" to break the promise. You're breaking it, and it's your problem to fix. I hope you get the help
The giant squeezed his nuts and balls between his arms so they don't touch but still look super close.
When he straightened up he was just a little bit too far to the side. It's possible to not do that and still make a clean hit. But he had just given up his whole arm for a chance to hit him in the head.
Please Harry get that money
I think Hermiones right of the field is the worst of this lot. But I'd like to see the others you mentioned as well, just not sure where I would rank them in terms of overall quality.

As the lift rattled to a stop, I could still smell the sweat and stale cigarette smoke. The heat inside the cab was oppressive. I looked through the mirror of the rearview camera to see if anyone was watching. It was a dark, empty lot. And the

emblazoned across his chest. He didn’t look quite the same, like maybe he’d spent the last ten years aging and becoming wrinkled, but in his eyes he was as youthful as he’d been as a boy.
There he was the last Friday of April.
Once Hagrid had crammed all of the books into the trunk of his car, he couldn't stop thinking about Hermione.

Often said Mr. Weasley: “If a dog were able to talk, it would sound like Mr. Weasley.”
Holding his lamp up, he looked out at the crowd.  "If you have friends, I have the means to make them disappear."  He was an extremely bright man who didn't like people bothering his mind.  "It's not like I have a choice
And they believed that if they didn't take care of us, the rest of the world would.   Edit: I’m a simple man, I see a man speak of warring nations in my own country, and I want to say “yes

Everyone out It was a fantastic run
Ron was right behind Harry in the fight against the dursley's. The dursley's were so powerful it took two dragons to take down one of them. So Harry had to kill them at least that many times.   I could be wrong.
Only joking I am actually a mod so if you do anything else don't worry. But this sub has been a lot more active recently and I don't think it will die because of it
Harry recognized it partly because it was one of the more 'femme' looks.  But yeah, I agree. I think the reason a lot of people don't remember it so clearly is because it was a pretty major plot twist for Harry that was so subtle
Uncle Vernon stopped at a diner on his way back from lunch and was shocked to discover a large, hungry cat waiting at the counter for him.
Dumbledore in tended next to a large black cat when the professor came out of the classroom. Dumbledore immediately recognized the cat, and the professor asked why it was so large, and what it would do.

After all to the best of my knowledge, they did not have any other choice. As for where the hell they are now... I dunno. They still have those weird "things" that we call "eyes" with which they look down at their victims. But,
Harry hastened to join me. I had just come out of a meeting, and I could tell my heart was breaking.
Arthur told us you're welcome to come visit?   You want to come visit a dude who just killed his mom?
A horrible halfsucking half.
Harry lay in his bed, gazing out the window as he waited to wake, still waiting for his father to return from the hunt to find out what happened to his family and for him to discover what exactly had been in the notes he had seen tucked away in his father
With the whole of the world watching, India can only play safe, says Mithali Raj after series defeat against Australia
After squinting at Ron’s shirt for a while, the picture made my eyes focus on his bicep.
Strong likelihood Undesirable No. 1 is a bad idea, or at least a bad choice.
He was also sure about the war in the first place. He may be a fool, but he knows a lot of shit. I really hope he's not going to go "dumb" like the rest of them have.
Oh thank goodness Howie is gone
Ron a few seconds into the clip: "Holy shit that's crazy."
You heard what Mr. President, right?  If Russia were to come at us, I'd like to say that the US would be able to retaliate by bombing the shit out of their nuclear facilities, but I would be lying if I wasn't expecting that the Russian population

Wildeyed Mundungus dived for the ball on the edge of his own area and his shot, from the edge of the penalty area, looped in off the bar.
It didnt look like it would have been a good idea to go with a 2.0 instead.
The troll didnt even put an effort.
Thank you Ron but it would appear your mind is not your own.   The government owns your body.   Your mind is only allowed to think on an individual basis.   If you are in agreement with this then you are in agreement with the state.
Then a powerful blow to the noggin by Mr. X would just knock them unconscious?
Glass cut his cheekbone on the top, that could lead to bleeding or infection
Itishappening Ron said Lupin.  He's been trolling all week.    Edit:  I am stupid, lol.

Like MouldontheWold Godrics Hollow is still up and running
What dyou reckon happened?
The idea of Voldemort being an intelligent wizard was just so overblown in my opinion
And are they bothering to take people like you on to see what the actual problems are? Like how you do not have internet, are in a foreign country, and only have mobile service.   How are they measuring this?
He was still gray in the eyes of the jury
Moody quite unconcerned was saying that he just wanted to see how it would go and it worked out perfectly.
As he passed gleamingly across the room, I saw how much was being left to the last minute.
Harry its okay wake up it will be good when you get back you will be ok in a month you are such a good parent and you know your kid better than anyone that is why you took the day off to see them it will be alright but you need to think
Chapter Ron wrenched the door open with his right hand. His left hand closed it to keep the door shut. He then stood back up and looked at the door.   *Shit.*
We shouldnt have gone full on anti-gun people.  We should have gone full on pro-Second Amendment people and taken away all government guns in every situation.  Then once enough people like the idea of guns, we'd get rid of every other gun in America
The forest is not a garden, I tell you.
Harry crossed his fingers and smiled, the last of the darkness draining from him.
Ill keep watch for you. It could be a long haul though, that's a nice amount of time for a player to miss.
Next moment thirty or forty years from now when your grand kids complain about being stuck in the house all day.
Ropes sprang out of the ground in an attempt to reach his face, to make sure he wouldn’t see. “Look!” a voice shouted through the trees, and he could see the figure of a young man.
Only the sea and the waves. I think the only other way it’s possible is to go on the beach and make a wave but that’s just really dangerous.
Clinging on for dear life: What is 'the Great Escape'?
Shouldnt take more than a day or so.
Use the boy...Quirrell rounded the corner of the great Hall and noticed the figure standing beside him.
I dont The Trace has nothing to do with the game. Its about how a company tries to hide problems in game that have nothing to do with their game.
It seemed to burn the bottom of your shirt where the straps were. Is that the correct area to apply?
Malfoy grinned broadly at the idea of having his son as his right-hand man in a case like this. He knew it would never work out - he’d be at least half the man he was if he could get a real man to fill in for him
Ersort of said Harry. The book is actually quite fun.
Dont worry about that, you're only in grade 9 so you'll be able to get a job in any area of the world, just keep at it.  My advice is to keep practicing your math and reading, you'll learn and it wont feel like an chore

Wood told me.  I was wondering about this as well. The other two are probably just taking the piss.   The way Wood speaks, I'm starting to think he's a bit of a twat too.
Trevor cried Neville blissfully.
He caught hold of a hot dog with his mouth, then held it in his mouth while he was being carried by his teammates.

Thats mine said Harry "I wasnt doing drugs that day. I was on acid. Its why I have never been able to remember this particular night".
From their high vantage point they can see a lot of stuff. I'd be willing to bet that's what's bothering her.
There was of coursenothing to him at all.
But when did you leave? I'm genuinely curious, because I'm really struggling to understand what you mean by "sitting through a boring movie".   I'll have to watch it though, in preparation for the upcoming release of Spider-Man Homecoming.
Mundungus did not look at the cards. He only saw a blank screen, and he knew that if he looked at the cards that he would not be able to win the battle against the three of them. He made a move that did not seem so brave at first,
Oh well I thought the comments were funny at the time, but it was a horrible decision to post them on youtube.  I think its pretty obvious that we have the power to make a negative change at this point.  I would like a discussion that I think will

Youve still got the original copy of the PS4 so you don't even need to spend your money.  And for $60 you get every game on the system (except God of War and Horizon) at this point.  I say you should do it man.
On the count of three, each soldier will be charged with firing a single shot.
I didnt think there was any way that a guy that was so tall could do it. Even after a few years I cant do it
With a scowl on her face, she held her cup of tea in one hand, and her purse in the other.
And he didnt need those. In order to make the money he would have to buy all those cards for himself. And then pay to have them done.
Had Hagrid collected that ball at the end... would have been a nice ending.
Those who could add the best to their lives.
His appearance was causing me problems on a lot of occasions.
He approached one of the guards, looking slightly nervous and shaking slightly. “I’d like to speak to Major General Tresillian.”
I found out something about the car I bought. I didn't know I could make it go faster before buying it, but apparently you can. I had to have it towed. This car is way, way faster then I ever expected.
In the weeks that passed between the U.S. presidential elections of 2016 and 2017, and between the inauguration of Donald Trump on January 20 and the end of his presidency on January 20, 2019, the United States witnessed an escalation of conflict in Libya. The Trump administration
Hermione looked pleasurably ustered after reading her reflection in the mirror. Her golden hair was tied up, and her golden dress was hung at her waist. After the morning tea, she had put on her new clothes and had been in the bath for at least five minutes, and
QuickRon threw the cloak around to make it seem like he had some control over it as he didn't want to hurt anything. But the cloak was actually his.
She pulled out a gun and shot a guy.   You're an idiot if you think that isn't a fucking tragedy.
Every morning they made the same statement; "the suns will rise in the east".

When the mail arrived, I checked it. It contained my name, the address and the name and address and contact information of my daughter's friend, Sarah.
Harry pulled back his hair and stood up.
We know theyve stopped sending in the video because the internet has already had a chance to dissect it (and it's still pretty funny) and will be looking into the specifics tomorrow, but I wouldnt be surprised if they go back and make some changes.

Once they had pitched the idea, and I had seen the potential for their marketing (in addition to the design, layout and layout of the product itself), I knew that I had to take action and get this product out there. There has always been a need for a
Nah were best left alone.
Harry glanced back at the young man. He was right. “Not at all.” He grinned and waved him over. “Go ahead, be my guest.”
Dumbledore reached out and touched Ron's cheek, then reached up to the rest of his body until he reached his fingers in his hair. “Ron?”
Why has it taken you so long? I'm on my fifth attempt at getting a 100% on a game. I'm on PC.
They hurried out of the room and made no attempt to explain themselves. This, they knew, would prove the most critical point of the argument.
Every twelve hours The sun will get stronger in your area
Hagrid whooped andclapped and said, “Gee, Ginny. I think that is the best thing I have seen all day.” “I should go,” said Ginny, but she knew Harry was not ready to go yet. Hagrid had promised
The child had not a voice?
The what You and I Know. That guy was a fucking genius.  I also enjoyed the "What Does It Mean to Die". A really cool film about people who try to understand death. It was made by Stephen King and directed by Paul Schrader.
They say theres dragons in there, but it's just a bunch of lizards with wings.

I reckon weve got one game, then a few games off so this would be nice for our starters
Hermione snatched up the book and shoved it in her bag. She looked at Harry then at Sirius. "What is it?"
Now Harry woke with a start, trying to remember where he was and where he had been. His hand went to the mark on his right cheek but he couldn't feel it. He tried with all his might to reach out to touch it but he just couldn't.
Take this stuff upstairs, it's the only safe bet you got left.
Theres already a good thread on this you fucking moron.
She had dark red hair. I think that was the biggest clue.
If Voldemort nds out that Sirius is innocent, he may just destroy the Dark Arts and make this whole thing a waste of time. If Sirius isn't responsible, the death eaters will still want revenge, which could lead them back to their original plan of destroying the school
But Im going to the game so its ok!
But before we hear anything about those two subjects, there’s still one more major question before us.

He came to a city in the middle of nowhere, the middle of his back. He didn't know anyone, no friends, no family, he only had one thought, to find the one he loved.    So he did.
said Professor McGonagall staring at a picture of the last person to wear a scarf on the train.
You did do the right thing.  You're not a monster.
Dudley wasnt used to playing with those guys. He was just a kid in the league when they started playing together.
Even this very short film is a work of art.  It's a love story from before they both saw the light, with a heart wrenching ending.
He had an idea and was too weak to actually pull through but this was the next best thing. He may have been weak to the idea but what did it matter when you had a wife, kids, a job and a few dollars in the bank?
Well as regular listeners of the podcast you'd know I don't really care about "game development." I actually just want to know what you thought about the game, not what it looks like. So, for now I think it's cool, and I want to see

The Trace breaks at 10pm every night in Toronto. I love it. They call it the "local news" or the "talk" so I always assume it's about whatever's going on on the street.
He seized his rucksack and began walking down the hall, trying to stay on his feet without pain.
Harry and Dudley promptly broke up, but Harry did not stop writing, and a year later, he was invited to a meeting at Hogwarts with the trio of Bellatrix Lestrange, Lucius Malfoy, and Ron Weasley. Harry, who had been waiting for them since

Harry had even less control than her. He was just on the side of the castle, and didn't have much power or knowledge of the Dark Lord's realm.
But Master Regulus had taken her into his chambers where he offered her a new life.
Hagrid looked down at his bloodied wand. "I'm going to need you to keep this."
Calm I will not be
Hagrid seized his umbrella, and as he swung it out, he muttered something in his ear. It took a few seconds for Harry to catch his words.

We cant expect it to be perfect. I just dont understand why people try so hard to hate on it. The game is still alive and well and they need to take away all the negatives from this game to grow it.
Please could we talk about how the fuck this game has become the most popular thing ever? I just don’t get it.
Hagrid grinned at Harry. "How did you do it?"

Dumbledore was staring at me the whole time when I was there. It's like I never left.
Im so so sorry. I lost my dad to cancer at 26.  Its a struggle but the best thing you can do is surround yourself with like minded people. I have a very great support group that I've had from early on in my life.
The old elf rocked!
The Elder Wand is a terrible wand in the books. It was supposed to be destroyed by a fire, then accidentally got found by accident in Harry's backpack, then was saved and taken to Dobby's (whom Harry had killed) house. Then Dobby accidentally
In his vast muscular body, the king of dragons appears as a strong and sturdy creature. He has three heads, each adorned with a crown, and six sets of horns in the sides of his shoulders. His head seems to hold the whole kingdom of Rhaegal and
Hagrid wiped his nose with the back of his hand and rubbed his lips with the other.
Bidding the wizards farewell after 13 years
I dont mean holding the mouse, i mean moving the camera around with the mouse wheel while playing the game
Ron dived at Malfoy and pushed him up, causing his robes to start flying off.
I believed a dierent theory that was posted here but I want to ask, do we know how long it takes someone to respawn in GTA Online?
Neville had panicked and given up a penalty at the same time, he had no idea that the penalty was even there.
A note fell out of the sky and stopped with her head. Her eyes were burning.
Sometimes when he strained his biceps, he would put his hands in the air like he was gonna make a dunk.

Now revealed for the first time in his debut book
To make a fool out of my mother!
You know rst holiday is only two weeks away, right?
His insides clenched like they were trying to escape from his guts
He was a Death Walker, didn't you hear? He killed someone before. I think the game would have been way more interesting if Death Walker was a playable class. (Not really my taste but I am still cool with him being playable)
Yeah theres a lot of other things he could do with his life instead of shooting himself in the head. There's a reason most people that shoot themselves dont get an autopsy and nobody gives a shit.
Dudley and Piers wanted to be more than friends. They had no business sharing a bed, and yet they could not help themselves. A few nights ago, they had met under an umbrella at the end of a warm summer day. Now they’d spend the evening

You will know one or the other of the twins have had a stroke. Just trust me, I'm an aunt.
And a few of us have a chance to buy into that team, and we can't because our best players don't want to play for this team. :(
As darkness drew in, it was the one person in the world the two didn't know would be awake.
I didnt see you at the game last night.  I will be in this year!  I've been to the game twice in the past 2 weeks and I've really gotten into it
surely you know where he got that hat?
They walked more slowly today than in the past two games, probably because the weather has changed. I imagine some are more tired.

He stole downstairs without permission? WTF? How did the upstairs guys not hear this?
They were closer to each other and were more attractive. What is there to debate? It's not really an unpopular opinion.
Look Hermione seized ahold of this.
Got it said Hagrid from Harry Potter.
Married to Reginald Cattermole.
yeah then he said:  >They should be happy with what they got for all the time they've played on it.  yeah because I know how you felt last week when you got the skin for your skin
Mums been trying to figure out how long it takes them to orgasm for 20 years.
He then sank to the bottom of the sea and swam up to the surface and threw up.
Shame about notfinding Flamelurker, but I'm quite happy that the fight was done.  My character's name is Arzemolay, if anyone cares about the origin of that name.
She had made her decision.
Now I want a giant, hulking creature that uses no weapons that you get after destroying one of its arms.
Ron couldnt see what it was but he wasnt too pleased with the results either.
And finally I must say...
But no matter how much you change, what’s behind it isn’t going anywhere.    You have a chance for a second chance and are in control. I’m not sure I’m really grasping your point yet.
My my mom and aunt have both died from cancer. Its fucking amazing that you would let someone else's death dictate the kind of life you want to live.
Harry felt an awful chill when Draco appeared before him in a robe and a mask.
he neednt have bothered. just get in at the point where the map is going past the end. youll get the last couple rounds. if youre in a 4-5 team, it doesnt matter. the point is you cant go in with less than 7 people.
She had a great run
Darkness engulfed them along with the moon
Say the cloak existed I would use it.    I hate the cloaking abilities in star wars games.  It's a stupid mechanic.
So I took it. And what should I be able to do? I get my results in a few weeks. Any ideas?
But Snape always seemed so gentle to me.
Uncle Vernon stayed at my house last Saturday night in his usual spot and slept all through the night and didn't even go out of bed to eat. I just left him in the sun room to sleep and was on my way to work. I was in my car waiting
Oh why did we have to let them go?
That diary sort of looks like a cat scratching itself.
It felt wonderful to get back to the “good old days” in my mind.
Thelow buzz of chatter about the latest round of "fiscal cliff" negotiations is like the sound of a bell. The sound of the bell is the sound of a bell that has stopped ringing, a bell that is no longer the only bell in the world.
Lupin drew his wand and was about to start a wand-tossing competition when a tiny owl suddenly appeared and started dropping items in his way. He looked up in time to see it carrying a golden orb in its beak.  "Who the hell do you
Wheres Dumbledores office They need to make this a TV show or something, so much stuff I need to know
Do something he said to you when you were drunk. Say something stupid. Act like an asshole. It should work.
But the nights surprises us -
When Harry finally left Voldemort he was on top of the world. The house cup final was one of the most exciting games to watch that I have ever seen.  It was also the last time that Harry had been able to really focus on just being Harry again.
Harry stood quite still in the doorway, eyes locked on Riddle’s face. He had seen him many times, even before the man would take control of the wizarding world; a man who possessed no natural magic, a man who was bound by a dark
Just as long as it works.
Harry tore it open from the inside. I don't know why but that just made me crack up.   I would also love to see the rest of the series. Would you be interested in selling it as a graphic novel?
They fell with dull and dolorous voices.
We use unicorn hairs too... just not in the butt!
Thats a good idea and I'll be the first to agree that the game was better when there were no perks. Maybe make them for classes like Scouts.
Dont be silly Harry, it would be to risky, Voldemort is already aware of our existence so they can just create copies of us and then we can still be killed.  Dont you think he'd want to stop that?
Welcome said Hagrid to Dumbledore before he was murdered.
Meanwhile Harry had started his training early.
Which means Dumbledore called him out on his bullshit. What a dick.
Voldemort needed an elf because he could see inside an object like the diary
Lost in thought he might fall or something.
And once it was discovered it would work on a small budget, they started making it work for a lot less.
Heads down yelled Hagrid's "Ow ow ow!"
Five minutes later Ron was on his knees on the floor, with a smile on his face and the girl laying on his chest.   "I like you. You're special to me. I like you."
His names Scabbers and he loves the smell of burning hair
Filch was alreadythere and you never mentioned it!  I thought to myself :D  Nice to see a fellow Filch fan.
He clicked it once and saw the results so he clicked it again.
Some idiots copied it too much.
Im hoping to do it as well. I will definitely send you some more details and info
To Miss Hermione Jean is a crime
He climbed the steps of Mt. Olympus and back with that performance. The fact that it was the same guy in both takes is mind-blowing to me.
Dumbledore had at least two sons.
A bundle of walking stick and a bunch of sticks wrapped in cardboard.
Rons prediction came true lmfao
He turned away from me...
They dont look very old, especially for two. I wonder what happened to her.
Harry wheres Hedwig She's got a nice head on her shoulders
Ioh all right then.  This was pretty cool.  I didn't know you could put your stuff up on the internet.  Nice work.
Harry seriously doubted this when he was younger. He didn’t even like the idea of flying a broom. He was afraid of falling or getting hurt. He doesn’t seem to worry about this when he’s with Ginny because they have a flying
Report himNeville shook his head and sighed. He had heard the man's plea and wondered why the old man had not been able to come with.
Ginny poured her heart out to Arthur. He was willing to accept that and so was she. They had made it work in secret for several years, just trying to be ordinary and be together when people doubted, but now things had changed and they were out in the open
Good said Moody as she added: "The report of a plane crashing into a plane is not the kind of thing we expect to see at the beginning of the flight. In aviation, it's an extremely rare event."
Im so sorry to hear about your loss.  I don't think you can give up, you'll get it next time.  And if you ever need someone to talk to,  I'm here.
Will George be okay?  I know he's a celebrity and all but if I lost my entire family in a car crash and the next thing I'm thinking about was how to pay for the funeral and what not.. it would be a long day for me..

I heard you. I saw your name.  There was that time we had sex. Twice. And I left.   But you were right about one thing, you're great.
He was going to put a bunch of holes in the ship?   Why?
And then youll be stuck
Harry stopped at the top of a long staircase as he made his way to the room where he had last been seen. He'd barely gotten inside the house before he'd started hearing screams from inside a cupboard, and that's all he knew until he was face-
Hes not exactly recent, but if you like the movie *Mulholland Drive* its similar
He addressed Mr. Thelma, “That's not my name.”
He grinned at Harrys' smile. "It's good to see you again." He held his hand out for Harry to shake.
No Harry shouted and the entire show got derailed in the next 5 minutes.
He cleared his throat. His jaw shook. His eyes blazed. “I’m sorry, but I can’t have a one-woman show, and I won’t accept an offer to do it.”
Harry laughed but he was not impressed. He did not want Harry to suffer the humiliation of losing to his former apprentice and his own daughter's boyfriend on her first attempt at a fight.
Oh no oh no oh no!
Fallen Warrior Thanks said “Thanks” to the men and women of the U.S. Army who made it possible for him to do what he loved.
But this he pointed out, was not the case when a private sector company was given the same right:
How nice to see you back! Great photo.
Bin busy we got a good start.  We're going to have some time to relax after this and maybe get a bit more organised.
The evidence is that all children are victims and deserve protection.
I thought this belonged on /r/cringepics...
It struck and Hermione was sent flying, but she landed with a squeal, almost in the center of a crowd of people.
Then he turned to all his friends, and with a wink, said: "See what a fine and useful fellow I've found."
When you could have given everyone a chance to vote for that candidate they wanted to vote for. Instead, they choose to go with the guy who made them angry with his lies.
Filch was handing Snape his Death Eater wand for all his bad behaviour. What a cunt.
Three Chasers Harry repeated "We can't all have a party here tonight."  And that was on the first episode!
She opened the book up to one side. A black velvet cover caught her eye and the white paper inside was written in a pale black script, "For The Love Of My Country." Inside the book was a faded white map, marked with the name of the county and

Ted Tonks looked up to a certain little red-haired man who wore a red cloak and red trousers. He knew he could trust him. The cloak was made of white silk material that was tied at the waist, and the trousers were of fine material that matched with the
The snake jabbed its tongue at the woman who was walking with her friend, who was on the phone with her boyfriend.
Mr. Weasley had therefore not expected Harry to be surprised, but still he found himself grinning wildly at the sight of Mr. Weasley's mouth, though he was aware it had not been for the first time.
Why is he with her?
I arrived in time to make my first trip to the zoo the other day! It’s so much smaller than my city’s, so my favorite part was the birds. I didn’t get to see the gorillas, but the monkey species

It was in Godrics.  He does the same thing to any opponent that goes down.  The only way to escape this is to avoid him.  If he jumps on you, stay on top of him and wait for him to fall.
Disguise yourselves and run. When the police find you, pretend you never left, and don't let go until they give you their ID and badge.
Now he said turning off chat? What about turning it on?
Goblins Hermione mouthed at when she is in hogwarts is absolutely hilarious, she looks so confused
We woke up and were told that the flight has been cancelled and that everyone was off the plane.
And saying the magicwords like "I'm going to kill all those fuckers for you"

You never told him you were pregnant?
I dont think Lunas gonna be able to get much of a boost. The meta isnt gonna change, and her damage is gonna be pretty low for any top player who knows how to play. The best way to counter her is to make her completely reliant on landing her
Yeah said Ron emerging from his slumber.   This guy would definitely have an eye for a good story if he had the time and/or talent to be an author. Not really that hard to find a good story from his past.  He seems like an
He decided his best bet is to take the next flight out to BKK and then fly back to Melbourne. He has no plan B.
Most celebrated of these "great moments" (when? before? after?) was when he was voted "MVP"
All the other stories I've read about him, I thought they were all just jokes. I was genuinely interested about him and now I'm not so sure. He really is a person and a jerk.
Look at it Hermione!
between you and Everything_is_Fucking_Awesome, the most depressing and down-to-earth, I would agree, although it does make me think "I should really write in my journal..."
Like Harry she felt that her son was very strong willed and would not follow orders which meant that Voldemort needed something to take his mind off of killing her. At least, that's why I always interpreted it. I don't think Hermione would have had much of a
Nothing said Ron eagerly.  He sat up in the chair, not bothering to grab the small bag of food from the kitchen.    "And what do we get from these?"
His long white candyosses
And then out of nowhere there is a giant hand poking the air, so he jumps out of the plane and runs off, leaving his sword behind and a huge hole in the clouds.
The bloody trail of our enemies leaves behind footprints... but in a sense they have no trail... so we should call it the "tourist trail"
The guard had never seen that before. He looked up at it in shock. "I see what you are trying to do. Why would you do something like that?"  He turned the camera off and pulled the switch to send the video feed to the main facility's
No Ive got Morgana, I need more of the new skins to fill out my collection.
Hermione wouldnt hear of it she's too busy helping Ron with some kind of potion
He watched as his team and his girlfriend walked past him, into the bar. The bar was packed. The bartender was on the stool.
How he had managed to get a video camera in to a church? I would have thought they would have taken it away once they realised what he was doing.
The realization crashed over me
The books she was reading, I’m guessing Harry Potter
Ron was great said a lot of people.    He's also in a much better place mentally and can be very funny on occasion.   But I'm not sure he's a comedian any more.  I feel like he used to have a more natural

Probably he was telling her to get in the house, which would explain why she was standing around. He definitely had a very specific and very understandable plan for the next step, and he's got your back, just take it one step at a time. Don't feel
He felt so ashamed. Not so much for what he’d said, or what the judge had said, but for the way he looked.
Yet again somebody had to tell me they weren't doing a good job.

Then over the rush to get home, you have a massive boner.
Hermione whimpered as Ron held onto her hips. Her lips parted. He felt her trembling.
Hermione was fast asleep in the dorm room after her long drive, the wind in her hair making her dreamscape seem more vivid than it really was. Hermione's eyes had begun to close and, before long, the sun had set, sending her down the hill. Hermione
You heard me on this one, right?
But that doesnt mean I can't be bothered to try the new features. It would be nice to play some of the old stuff with the new stuff, it's an extra step in the process.
Weve got a couple of people but not a single active raid team :(
He stooped down and opened his mouth slightly, revealing that his yellow teeth were completely white. He was also a bit overweight, and his long, flowing black hair was slightly greasy. The two young females, all named Ashen, also looked identical to their father.
He could also see himself as the last guy at the bar when it comes to paying bills and taking out the trash. He needs to stop being so damn aloof and show some romantic interest, even if you don't feel the same way about him.
He was about to get banned on /r/politics so I told him to post to /r/conservative
And if it had been a *Tiger* instead of a *Tiger*-III it would've been an *R6*
Sorry said Harry sure he wasn't lying?
He doesnt need to do it, but he is entitled to do so. He isnt going to be president or anything.
However the truth seems to be that we've all agreed to the same rules...

If they dont get in, i think a second round pick is fair
Neither Ron nor Hermoine should have ever taken up a role like that.
Isnt it the same people that believe all this shit about 9/11. I mean if it wasnt for 9/11 nobody would have started this whole "truth is a lie" bullshit.

His ngers closed around him. He was a big kid, still carrying a few beers. One of those 'the more you know' type of things. He knew there was a problem, but it wasn't his fault. He was an easy mark.
They stepped toward the edge of the room, and I could feel their footsteps on the carpet. "Why?"
But I expect youve been at that table for years
Feeling nervous Harry followed Harry through the doors of the Gryffindor Common Room to the first table where they saw a bunch of new people sitting and waiting on their food, including Tonks, Neville, Lily and Arthur.
They had the dormitory style ones but when i was there they went out of business.
He was not being polite, he was clearly trying to get attention and was doing a poor job at it. I think that being "polite" to this level of asshole is in itself an achievement. You have my respect for staying cool about it.
What about the Cloak and Dagger from the last raid?
He knew Neville like a son he was like a father to him   I know his words seem hollow and empty, but he was probably the last person he would have spoken to after this

This was just an observation, because I noticed it this week with some of my games.    You never really want to take a 2nd tier minion, because in the current meta you can't really punish them without a ton of pressure.    And

It would tend to make sense that a character that is "unlucky" in love would have a rather sad and dramatic life. However, sometimes the characters will have less dramatic lives and they'll have even more love.  My best example is one of my all

His face fell because he was thinking, "I'm such an idiot."
Perplexed Harry looked to Hagrid and said, "Sir, my wand will not work on that creature?"
His face wasnt twitching in a way that was obvious the whole time. If anything it seemed like he was staring into space, maybe he wasn't even aware what was going on, just doing his best to ignore the things he saw. The dude was clearly dazed and

He sat down next to me on the grass outside the school, and told me to stop crying, that I was fine, and that nothing would ever happen to me.

It seems clear therefore that the only way to make the best of an extremely difficult situation is to play the game. And we do.
He turned right around and I was on the ground, crying, begging him to come back to me.
Kreacher nicked loads of things to get him to the end. I don't know what his final goal was (I assume it was the one from the beginning, it took the team several minutes to realize he was gone). The one with the most significance was the one that

Harry watched Thicknesse march past the castle and into the village of Ainsdale, a mile up the road.
It was cool and all that but I just had to know that what he did in the end wasn’t done on purpose to see if his character’s powers would be the same. And then it isn’t.
Hermione had not packed enough clothes.
Harry felt drained empty. The wind, the rain, the crowd—all had taken a toll. He was tired, hot and thirsty, and that combined with the fatigue he'd suffered from the night before kept him from sleep.

Courseeveryone gets scared when they are told about it but the actual fear is of what it can do to your eyes after it is done. In the middle of the night or when you are laying in bed, you are the only thing that is going to be scared of what
It was sitting asstill. In the center of the road was a row of broken wooden stools, which were lying across the road from one another and looked as if they had been there for ages. Near the stools stood a mannequin, with its face painted
We had to Neville him to be safe, but Neville made Neville so much more powerful.    The two things I wish was different.    He could have been an older version of Azkaban that just so happened to be in an adjacent house for
One arm around Hermione's neck with the other holding a hand between them, their lips meeting for a kiss of such intensity that it would melt even the most hardened of hearts...
Charlie he said.Youre losing me.
Yeah maybe I will just do my weekly solo game until I'm in platinum lol
Well thats something Harry Kane didn’t score last night... I mean, sure I’m not saying you’re wrong because of it but it’s not like that would be the only thing for him to do tonight
nine maybe hed wakeup. but i doubt it
Thats to make it more challenging.  I like it.
For ze wedding she must be prepared to show up at 5:30 in the morning in the middle of the night, no makeup or anything else on. And she will need to wear a gown with a full bust.
well youve seen what happens after a few games with the meta of "what to build, what NOT to build" i dont think there isnt a need for a guide
Dyou think that was the most awkward moment?  How did you react.  I was at a friends house playing with her dog for 2 hours and when she went to do her homework she looked in the mirror and said "My boobs look weird"
Oh yes she said that too
Now Lupins tortured white twin brother, Edward, can rest in peace. The white twin has been beaten, abused, starved and tortured for all these years. Edward has to make up for all his sins. Lupin finds him a good hiding place in a forest. A
If only Id had the time... maybe itll be free in a few weeks
Brilliant and everything but I really do think they should go back to the art style of the movies, it's just as good now as it was then
He addressed the The New York Times to address the allegations and apologize for the way they are being portrayed.
The stairs are completely blocked off from the outside, so we have to drive in through a side door (not the side of the restaurant, we enter through an open back door, then make a left) and then drive down that to the stairs.
Dumbledore gave me the ability to feel guilt and I can't see myself ever not having that.
There cant be anything but a single person who knows a huge ass conspiracy like that.
They moved back up to the second highest, which is great, but the amount of people saying that this was a failure is nuts. These guys played their first NHL game in three years! If they aren't playing, they are working on their game, and that's
As the balding wizard in the back we can see the wizard's hair. As the witch in front you can see that she has a lot of black hair.
Crabbe and Goyle chuckled. "We'd love to let our sister out, but there are too many other things going on."
Firenze might back us, we'll see.
It was chalk white for me on my HTC One X
How often do you change the settings in your program in comparison to other drivers?    Do you have all of your settings configured to their maximum values? (Settings > Sound > Windows > Control Panel)
Harry heard Hermione gasp loudly when she heard the sound.
Yes yes thats right.
It was very strange. We would be talking and he'd randomly be like "hey did you watch that movie last night? So good!" then he'd say something interesting so I'd go check it out with him. Then in the morning we would get ready for school
Lupin pulled a few of the worst ones of them all. The worst of the ones we see aren't just "oh, we just missed a little bit, no big deal" - they outright lie about their size or weight/how many times they've been shot.
Then he held out his right hand, palms down, and said, “This is my ring; this is the gold that was set in my wedding ring. My bride gave this ring to me on our wedding night.”
He had always thought of himself as "the other" or a "special case". And his parents expected him to act that way - not to be his own person, but to be one of the guys.
He looked mean unlike usual
Bathilda looked up at the moon with blue eyes full of awe. She was an infant then, only about eight-weeks old, when she met the man, or rather her father, whom she had always known would come to save her. Her father, the king
Dudley raised a large family with a great marriage to his wife Linda. He was a wonderful father and son and was loved by all who knew him. He was a true American patriot and always took great pride in his country. He was a proud member of the United States
Thanks Kreacher said Harry is good at being a spy. It is a pretty good plot point.
Some inner certainty had to be in those two lines.
I dont want a remake, they are still my favorite band and this is probably going to be on the setlist.  This is just such a great show with a bunch of great songs.
Oh well if youre having such a hard time selling it to me i could help you out. Ill buy it for 5 keys
Keen for them all!  I'll pay good money for all of them.
Hed really done something stupid. Why would they just drop it like that? It was obviously supposed to be a surprise. He was supposed to go with a huge group of people in a helicopter. Maybe they just decided to drop it on a lake and no one saw it
Itll be the protectors of the land and the people they will protect, those that cannot protect themselves by the current methods. The one thing we know for sure is this, when they are gone, the very people that are trying to make sure they are not missed will leave
Yeah loads better Harry's than I am, but if you're going to do it...do it properly.
Harry crossed the room, feeling the cold air, and took in the mess on the desk.
Magic carpets all got fucked in the 80s, no matter how many times they been rebooted.
Areyou ghoulie or ghostie?
A hundred fat roasties in one room? Yes.
I still couldnt see the point in buying him after seeing how it turned out. Not to mention the fact that he didnt seem to go up in price over the last few weeks.
But I think you'd be surprised how many people do this. It's like the Americanization of Japanese culture or something.
How stupid they were not to just say, "Hey, I got this. We all have our moments!"  I get it's hard to be empathetic for someone you don't know, but at least explain that to them!  "Hey, I need
Mums getting edgy. My boy is in high school and getting fucked over for being'sick'.
Yet they remained close enough to the same size in the beginning to be able to produce enough to keep the population from starving.
But that wouldnt really solve the problem for many of us who have an addiction.
It mustve cost you a pretty penny, i like your style! I wish i got more into painting minis (and dming) a while back, i never had the time.
They landed quickly and easily; the landing gear had a full load when they landed. It also flew for a moment, and then cut off as soon as it touched down. They ran over to see how it landed, but couldn’t even see the entire landscape
an I said what??
It did not stir. The next morning, however, it was on fire. The police have arrested the suspect and seized the car.
SILENCE yelled Uncle Vernon, as he strode in the narrow hall to the door; and now I heard something more. The words of his voice were harsh--and so were his gestures. "I did nothing, and shall be punished for the rest. I did not
There was silence for two months and you're just now realizing this?
He asked if he needed a permit for it and the cops said no. So he went home and started his own club.
He could not bear to look at himself in the mirror anymore.
Right were changin groups on this one now
Wish McGonagall favored us as much as Snape did
Barrels of slimy stuffstood by the doors and on the shelves of the room, the glass of a windowshad a green-yellow tint. It was the only light in the room, and only the light from the moon. The green tint was enough to reveal all the
Nice view he said.
And if he survives, do they use the money?
He suspected hewouldnt have gotten through the wall, so he ran.   If he had stayed and gotten killed by the legion, he might've been the first one who got to the wall.   Also he had a good idea that he was gonna die at some
Funny said Harry really has a big dick. He must have some sort of mutant dick in him. I mean it really isn't that hard to get it erect.
Are we going or are we not?
Tried to frighten me during the night.. not.
The tea seemed to be pretty much all over the place for some reason. I mean, the color scheme and the flavors were all over the place and just kinda looked like a bunch of random flavors.
As hedrew closer he should be able to put out an even stronger offensive threat to make up for a lower speed of the last Pokemon.
When she reached the end.
Gryffindor will be in the south, right?
Ron was more interested in the hot tub.
I met him when he was playing at SLC a few years back.  He was quite nice and seemed to know a lot of the players well because he was always hanging around and talking.
She was staring at her phone
Get the mail Harry.Make it short.
Harry Im not sure how far you want to go, but we can try out the A.W.C or the old library, there are some other good things downtown like the arbour or even the new mall...
Wriggling around he cried, as his arms
Don expect youve had much luck here, but for some people like me, who don't have great luck with matchmaking (like most new players) it might be worth a shot. I got 3/4 of my 5s from doing matches there as I am a
It could have wrapped up the series in a couple of books.
Hermione was skimming through a notebook and found something that she had missed. Harry Potter. He was in Gryffindor common room with Ron and she could see him looking over the cover. What on Earth is he writing about? He is such a nice looking boy,
He came back a little over an hour late.  He also tried to claim that we didn't have an agreement,  but we do, as both parties are now in a better place.
Everybody looked tense watching him.
As for you Mr. D:
The traffic moved on that day at some point
You flatter me said, "I'd like to be a bit naughty"

He hurried to his house and put on his clothes before he even went outside and was waiting on the steps waiting for her to get there, but she didn't arrive before he did.   He pulled his tuxedo from his closet, donned it and threw
And why on earth is her head so far back?
Bit of a departure to start a new account. Can you provide more of an explanation? You said "there is nothing wrong with this". So now I'm curious if you actually believe what you said or just made this post to stir up shit.
Two gures had appeared in the local paper announcing their intent to seek a seat in the House. But then, one was a candidate for election in a district which had just one member and another was for an unusual political party, the Republican Club. I said to myself,
You did read that whole chapter right?  The main character has been fighting for justice and freedom for most of the last 200 years, and you're saying it's a bad thing?
Malfoy swaggered forward when he saw a man of the same age, build and bearing.      *He stepped forward and put a hand on his shoulder.*      "So, what brings you here, son?"
Oh didnt I tell you! Your girlfriend was a terrible person and I'm gonna punch her!
The pumpkin pasties seemed like a reasonable suggestion at the time...
Death Eaters for sure, but I have a feeling the death eaters are a bit too powerful.
and thats all very nice. but why would you even post on a public forum in the first place?
NB Youngest son currently at his dads. He had a great time. I am just so happy to have him home
He took back the word, and the way, with which it was spoken.
You look great Always look good man.
The sun shone brightly and the smell of flowers filled the air outside as I walked down the park path.
Fred said it hurts the players more than anything...they are now expected to not only do the same things as they have done in their own lives but also learn to be better sports when interacting with a coach like Bill.
Oh its nothing dear. No need to panic.
I have a copy. You can have it. What region are you?
Weve been told to buy a new laptop for around £150, we have to save for the best. Also, our current laptop is an alienware laptop so if we want something else, we should get a new laptop as well.
He seemed momentarily surly, but I sensed a more complex situation at play, and then realized that he was just looking over the scene, and trying to assess the situation more closely.  What happened to him?
Why that the three hour old account with an incredibly obvious spam?
I think I can see the future. It will be a "Steroids is bad, m'kay" thread
Then an object twitched in his stomach and a bright light illuminated the room around him. A young man with pale skin, dressed in a tight black and white striped robe, stood with his back towards him. The man was a thin man with long, curly hair that fell
But they didnt. They werent just in that one fight. Also they made some deals with the bad guys before that as well.
And then she would say no so you will be in the same situation
Something was moving inside her... But they couldn't seem to place the feeling and then the feeling became an actual physical sensation in her body.
It looked very solid.    Can you provide the script you were using?   For my taste, I would have like the game to feel a little more complex at first and make some bigger moves but for the game it looks like that would have been very difficult
He was sure Ginny Weasley would be back...
The fragment of soul I got.
The er sitting room on the fourth floor of the police station. It was a simple room and it looked rather nice with a couch in the corner, a comfortable chair and a mirror in the corner. In the centre of the floor was a tall wooden desk and there were
So why did he just not go into the other room, close the door, and call it quits?
Already the sun was up but I was still exhausted from staying up all night making the sign.  I didn't get to go to my classes, but I'm going to do some stuff online.  Hopefully will get some sleep.
So after that obvious victory I don't think you can blame them for being down about it. I am not saying he deserved it, but the fact that he was even hit that hard was bad, and the fact that he still stayed in the game for one more round
Professor McGonagalls voice trembled when he spoke of the
Harry put his hand up. "Yeah, yeah, whatever."
But they were not actually dead? They were simply trapped inside of your stomach.
MadamMalkin stood Harry on the right of the room, in his private view, and watched him intently.  She could see the effect of his attitude--not disdain, not impatience, but some deeper, darker emotions in his face, the quick, thoughtful glance which
I wasnt going to post this, i hate the idea but...   How about they fix up the servers before they introduce more shit like this.  This is the same shit they said they would fix with patch 6.0.  But we still have to play

Harry felt as though he needed to be there to protect and guide him. He felt an awful pang of guilt for not seeing that the wizarding world did not want his son. He knew he was being a fool but he couldn’t shake the feeling of

He couldnt tell us his opinion?

No one ever lived with the knowledge that people have always wanted the same thing; to feel good. This knowledge drives us onward toward a more joyful life. The world, so large and diverse and complex, offers more chances than ever before to do this - to find happiness
It was true that he was a bad person and did the worst thing ever but he had a lot going on with his life at that point, also in the early days he was kind of depressed, he's not a bad person, but he's mentally ill. I

Within seconds the whole subreddit is going to be an inferno with people arguing over which one looks the best.
He knew exactly what he was doing and he did it beautifully
Thats great said Harry_Bertram_Romeo. Now lets see if he can go all the way and become an astronaut
What is it he's talking about. Is it just like the old school 3v3? I haven't played since it was the new thing.
It was carrying him.    Don't get me wrong, I'd want my son to have the best chance at survival, but you never know.
Im comin Harry Hagrid!!
Keep it safe till you can open it up
How many cloaks have you got? I think that has a lot to do with it.

While Mr. Weasley repaired the wand, Professor Flitwick read the book.

With a funny muffled voice, she continued. "Heard he shot a little girl and a baby pig, and the baby pig tried to bite his face off."
Then he looked up and saw a big, bad, green bear.
Then she closed her eyes, and fell asleep.
Hedwig hadnt brought Harry into the ministry yet. The ministry had just become more popular and they werent in the middle of an investigation into a murder (which they were doing when she was around).
Then two of them started clapping.
We must stress this, not only for the sake of people who live in poverty, but for the sake of other people who don't have access to public health care or social benefits.   People should know they don't have to give up their health care to get
You reckon it was an act from the police?
Harry had just made a huge discovery and it was almost enough for him to make another decision, but it wasn't that it wasn't enough.
The door was hit when that poor baby was born.
The room went deadly silent.
He wouldnt believe they were both there if they told him.
Ive never seen anything like that before. What a great shot
Trouble is they mustnt be allowed on the streets at all. The police need to be vigilant and have a presence about every street corner or corner area to keep these fuckers in check
I want you all to know, that i only clicked this because of that "the"
With one great leap forward...
The goblin read the note carefully and began to move his left arm to lift himself out of his position. The note was in a language that was unintuitive for him, even to other goblins; and the goblin was not a particularly experienced traveler.
Kreachers sobs came in clutch. And yeah, it's been a bit of a rough week
He wasnt the only good person killed at that game
Indeed there are few players better than him in his position. His ability to score in bunches, his ability to come up with the key rebound when you need him, and his ability to play solid defense. What do you mean by the question though, OP?
Should call Filch I think he's gonna know who she is
weird Harry stared as if he had never seen this.
The solitary lamp they have hanging from the wall, to the left of the couch. It looks like someone's shadow (it's probably just their shadow) in a really good light...
Chapter None of the above (or just "norepinephrine"). For some people, it is a bit of both.
She ought not be trusted. I do not trust a word she says.
Im coming with you  to the big smoke
Harry they know there are other ways to get in contact with you. Don't call them back.
I believe the last scene of the movie takes place in the hospital. They don't explain the scene, but in an interview on YouTube, the doctor actually said that he did it because he wanted to "play around" with this new found powers. It was an April
There were deep scratch marks in the pavement, on the street outside the window, where the knife had cut her.
Harry wrenched the stopper out of the little boy's hands, and tossed it into the fire, sending a puff of smoke billowing up into the sky.
Didnt manage to lock in this time, damn.      I have the gpu on the way tomorrow (cant wait!) and am very excited for it.
Cowardly old wart said he is gonna vote for Hillary after all that he did to her in 2008 and to the DNC by giving Obama such a bad name.     I dont get why people think that.     They have always been for her.
If the Ministry and his employers have a problem with it, they can take it up with the Minister.  I doubt he would want them to be seen in public doing something he didn't support.
Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot, with his eyes narrowed, gazing in the face of a young woman, who, with a gentle gesture of an old acquaintance, was hurrying off, having found herself thus unexpectedly summoned.
No you should do what you want. I would be mad if I was a manager and he came to work everyday not to work. Don't do it. He probably isn't doing it because you want him to, he's not doing it because he wants you to
Hermione was lying on the top of her bed, her face turned away from Luna.
and he asked Kreacher to stop the training for him because he felt it was hurting him too much. And he wasn't even a character in his book.
Their very last exam of the day for me is a final exam. I would have been super depressed without it, but it's out of the way and done. So it's fine, and I'm probably happy because it's a break from school and it means I

Harry caught it and didn't tell his parents, and their only reason was it was too close to the birth. They didn't find out about his true parentage until after his wedding.
Wiping his streaming eyes with his hand, the 30-year-old said that the two have been in a relationship for just two years. "But it's so great," he said, "that it's only two years."
Did you think wedges were going to solve the age old problems?  You might think that, but I can tell you right now it's not gonna work.  The older we get, the slower we are.  You want to get more from your wedge?
Well said Harry slowly as he stared back at the figure of a woman in her late 40's.

And then he greeted him like a long lost friend.

Harry smiled back hoping to see something more enticing on his computer screen. He had hoped she would be looking at his computer in real time so he could enjoy the moment a little longer, but he knew how hard it could be to have real time access to her while she
He had thought that when he had been given the charge to kill his first man in the army, he would be given enough time to think and decide his action. This is what his family and friends had urged him to do. However, he took up the gun,

You shouldnt have said "you dont get much out of life"
Hermione drank the Polyjuice potion, she didn't have to because she wasn't allowed to have spells. I wonder if she had someone else do it for her...
He had a whole week off
What caused this abrupt change in the way the game was played?
Sorry I just think it's a little hard to take them seriously when they are making jokes about how a single dude's genitalia were "the most fascinating to behold" to a 5 year old.
She dropped the syllabary with the word "dick"...
I simply cant dance to this. I just dont understand how its so fun. I can understand why girls like it, and i can understand why guys like it too but i just cant enjoy it for any length of time.
He didnt know whether he wanted to play it.
How are yehHe walked into the arena
Meant ter turn him into what we have.
Harry heard something creak as they got closer to the house. He frowned as he looked at the house.
His face went from angry to genuinely happy the first time he beat the everloving shit out of that dude.
Startled Harry looked over to me, “Holly, is that you?” I smiled at him, “Yes,” I whispered, “I’m coming now.”
Most of the cottage industry-style restaurants are decent. You'll have to go down to the local hole in the wall and give them a shot.
It scuttled away at a rate of knots.  It didn't care about the speed of its descent.  It was on a course, with a destination.      It was the biggest I have ever seen and its belly felt like it was full of

I didnt really believe in God, I just knew it was there in a deep spiritual place, but my experiences were still very vivid, not at all like they are now.  It was probably more fear that I thought God was a person.  Then I started to

Well just have to say its a nice looking car and a great looking motor (IMO).  As for the driving its better than some I have used personally but not by much.   You could be using the clutch alot when you downshift on the highway but

He was tugging at the ropes on his back when I woke up the next morning.
The light was fading on the world. This was our last chance to see the sun on this plane. We were not about to let it slip away. We were all going to die.
After a moment or two in which he saw nothing, I noticed that the cat was not a white cat, but an animal that might look very similar to a white cat--a cat called "Black Cat." He was standing on the edge of a large, flat roof
Harry leaned up against the door, looking down at the small, greenish stone. The sunlight trickled in through the small window, and he turned his head slightly to face the door to the left. He looked out and saw a man and a small group of people
Angrier than ever he is.
What snapped Umbridge glancing into her wand to grab him. He would never have escaped that.
Thats that problem solved then.
Ill make some tea and cookies for you if you want.
Rons nerves were already shot after the game. If we lost there might have been a point he was on the floor.
Yeah youre right said on twitter about being on vacation right now but its a full time job as well
Wait till it gets back in season.
Every nerve in his body, every muscle in his body, and every inch of every part of his body was screaming, 'STOP, STOP, STOP!' At this point the nurse asked if I wanted the test to continue and my answer was 'No!' because I

Im going out of the city to a cabin in the woods for the weekend, so I will be watching with that in mind.  I think he will get at least one point tonight, or a goal and an assist.

What do you think about the book *The End of the Affluence Paradox* by Richard Wilkinson? It’s an interesting theory of how wealth inequality is increasing.

Neither of them seemed to be doing too well.
Meanwhile in Gaddley a man was jailed last week for being a dangerous offender. I wonder if they'll lock him up again for something else?
Yes trying on the clothes in the changing room.
As the evening drew to a close, it began to take on an odd feel. The crowd was thin, but I wasn't really sure why. It had been a long day, and a long week, and I was tired. There was no music on the radio
She leapt up from her bed and ran out of the room, slamming the door behind her.
Id not say no to a free turd with bacon on it...but I'm not going to ask to have some thrown into the air for me, and I'm not sure the dog would enjoy it much either.
We can put her in the oven with a pizza and a salad!
What if it was the opposite?  I don't see why people don't just wait for the next "upcoming" update and not update the game right away.  I guess there is always the option of using a mod and installing the map packs before the update
A single wand layon on the pavement near the bus stop with a red and white striped cover over it.
He made several important points.   > The question was not whether Obama “should” have acted, but, “shouldn’t” have acted. The same is true for anyone and any situation.  Is anyone arguing with that?

Gregorovitch said a high percentage of participants in the program were "looking at it as a last resort" and that there have been a couple of people who have told him how relieved they are to have gotten off the streets.
Krum was pointing at the ground because he was thinking about how he's never really been in this world
Youve really got an amazing taste in gaming music. I love the music in the game, and all your videos, keep up the good work!
Neville was bent double by Riggs, and he didn't have the energy to be so loud.  He was just trying to go along and not make a scene.  His wife and children would have gotten the fuck out of dodge in a hurry.
From time to time. I always go through my life pretending like I'm going to die. I don't want to live. My life doesn't matter. So I just sit there and do nothing. No one's ever going to know about this anyway.
Doi push it he.
He landed sprawled next to a metal grate, bleeding from his head, a bloody machete in hand. It was the end of his life.
He complained loudly about how slow it was, but the most important part was that the waiter didn't even wait for the tip. It was like he didn't care if we made him pay for his meal.
The teenage Sirius had been doing a lot of thinking and talking in his head.
Patronuses can change though, so if she comes back I would probably still keep using mine :P
He had spilled his secret, and there was no turning back.
When he tried to stop and you were trying to leave in the first place
Yes dont stop now. You might be too late for a refund but as of right now they will probably give you something. It’s been a while since I ordered something online and I was given back my money in like a week after buying it and getting a
Oh Im so sorry you’ve been going through this. I hope your therapist gives you more support than your friend does!
Mom and Dad were supposed to pick me up for school today. I asked if they had dropped me off yet, and they said no, they were still picking me up at the station.
And what were the options for the final question?
Hermione I think she's a witch and she might be part of the order, but is there some other reason why they seem so drawn to her?
I havent got any messages or anything from these guys yet but I have gotten a few from a different guy saying he was going to be there. And I really hope that it isnt me because this is like my first time going and I am really scared.
Lord Voldemort showed me a picture of the face of one of his victims.  He said, "Why is there a smile on your face?"  "Because, I'm enjoying myself,"  I replied.  There, I said it.
Gotta get up terribad and make a video on it.
The hairs on the back of my neck just stood up.  She's one of a kind...
Three sets of plain white pants?
Dont look at me like that. Im trying to help my brother who cant afford to go to a concert in a huge venue and now its coming up on a month and he still hasn't bought a ticket.
Ill see you later when you're not trying to be funny.
Harry noticed he gripped Hermione’s hand and the other woman who he had noticed was holding Harry’s attention also had her eyes focused on the others. He wasn’t sure whether or not she recognized him, but he knew she was aware of his
I think Hermione does it all the time.  But I would give that up if it meant a real fight over a girl.
Every time Harry imitated Goyle by pulling the head out of the chest.
And I dont suppose you plan on adding any other kinds of content to the game, just this expansion?
Youd be stiff if they went and got a full sized model...
It showed a mans back and the word "Hands Up"
Harry held it up. "They're coming. They're coming to get me. He's going to hold this, so keep out of it." He was trying to keep him as focused as possible, not letting him see the red or the pain he had in his eyes
Confuse it Harry said.
He hoped the roof would never let him down.
The book had broken my heart when I first read it and now I see the beauty of that chapter of her life. You have no idea how much it makes me happy when a story that you read in high school affects you like that, because it means you learned about
Okay men he said.And men are like. "So let's have an omelet in the middle of the night."
It was on their website for two months, but they didn't seem to have it online when I signed up. I asked them and they said that they haven't added it yet.
Just a bit of a tangent, but anyone else like it when the game is so incredibly slow, it makes for some interesting moments when the ball actually moves and you just barely miss the pass? And then you get to the replay screen and the goal is scored.
Made an excuse did not show up at work.  I know I am not the only one who does that.
Beneath the robe be wearing a mask of some kind to help you breathe properly. Your head may be ajar during some breathing exercises, so make sure it's not covering the top of your mouth. If you feel like you can't breathe properly, take a breath and
Was this the answer you were looking for?
Dyou think Im going to be able to see your tattoo?  Jokes aside, I am a massive fan of your tattoos. Keep up the amazing work!
So all Ive got left from my trip with my partner is the little baggie full of weed I picked up, its been sitting for about a day and a half, and now i think I'll just keep it in there until we go back home. How should I
Harry dropped his arms. "Okay, so how are you holding out so far?"
I didnt mean nothing, and I'll apologize if I have offended you. But I thought this was funny since it was in response to your comment...
And where did you get that sweet tat?
Chapter Probably to show his relationship with the girl and then have the flashback with the girls, where they all go back together at the wedding and the other guys that they made up.
The boat Uncle Vernon rode in.
Neville hesitated then clambered from the sofa, pushing to the ground.
Although rather touched he had to admit, it was only a matter of time.
I know Viktor said the last part of the name in the comments for the picture but what do the other two guys say?
After a minutesweaving about it, we managed to land on a good time.
Harry must have walked out on you because he's too fucking obsessed with his fucking wife and doesn't give a shit about anything else, he doesn't know how to be an adult, but that's the other issue. He has no interest in you and that's fucked
I think Ill go with "no." But i don't think a small amount of weed for a month would be as noticeable as any drug used to get stoned for a month.
Hermiones scream mingled with the sounds of the crowd as they burst out of their shells, "We're in your living room! This is it!"
This is boring Dudley.
Leaving his enemy dead is one of the simplest ways to achieve peace.
He looked down at the small piece of cloth and shrugged a bit.
Sick at heart he couldn't make it to the event, but a wonderful sendoff. I'm looking forward to seeing more of these. If only the new album would have come out in June instead of August, it would have been perfect for this.
Well what if he was really dead?
Harry if were trapped on a deserted island with our lord and savior   Jesus if our Lord and Savior is trapped on a deserted island with our lord and savior
What he bellowed writhing like a sea monster.
Im sorry he said this, he clearly is a fucking ass.  But for the love of fuck, he didnt write it for you to read.  If i were you, i would block the guy and keep to myself when youre alone.  I know its
Then to his relief, it seemed that he had succeeded, for he was soon told that his mother was with him, and in due course of time he was able to be taken to his hotel. He was so pleased to find himself safe, that in his wanderings
Not until the doors are opened. And then it needs to be closed after a week or so.
Harry turned the doorknob of the bedroom, which was on the bottom floor of Hogwarts Castle, and opened the door.
Oh yeah Auntie Muriel. She has it all.
An owl hooted somewhere near me at 3am so I turned my lights off. I woke up to the sounds of something hitting the window, not a fly or something in the door (I had just been closing my door) - it was a cat.  I was
The repaired alarm clock and watch are a fantastic addition to my kitchen! They're so great that I can't even find a place for them on my vanity/hutch!
At the sound of his name it seems like he's a really cool guy! I really appreciate the fact that he didn't try to pull a fast one on you and instead just said what he had to say.  Just a quick tip to be careful about not using
The floor Harry suggested. What other answer did she expect? He couldn't get his mind around the thought of Harry being there and her never mentioning him again.
They must show that they can't be wrong, then they will give up.
If hed known who was going to be playing as him, hes would have chosen a different skin than what he chose.
For one trembling second, I thought this was /r/trees.   Anyway, don't feel like you have to feel like that, it's okay not to feel like that. Keep that mentality going. Don't overthink it. It's okay if
But on the other hand, how many of our favorite comics that were published in the 50’s and 60’s have seen their popularity and impact dwindle? I’m guessing there are many. That is why The Big Bang Theory should not only
And of course you don't want to buy it from a site that offers refunds in less than 24hrs.
This was why Harry had to die. It was the right thing to do.
Their trunks had already been broken in during their run to the championship. I'm fairly certain a lot of them had torn a muscle or sprained something by then.   It's hard to explain how they could fight for the title like they did without breaking their bodies
Diagon Alley Hogwarts the Game
A tiny man in a blue vest with a green fedora.
Ron tore his eyes out.  He is a man who has his own thoughts, does not need someone to tell him what to think.  Ron has spent his life trying to make himself a person of honor, dignity, and self respect.  It should not come
Listen Im glad weve had a few solid QBs over the years but im tired of seeing him throw on us. Lets trade him for what? A fifth round pick? A first? And give us a fifth rounder back for him? Id take him straight up.
How could a car company fail? They can't sell cars
With an anguished look in his eyes, he looked back at me.
Well you cant do anything to help them. They are completely free to do whatever they want, whether it be good or bad
Harry hung back for years. When he finally spoke he never made himself very clear.
YouKnowWho put it there, because you can't get a boner from that face.
Reg I dont understand your question...
Hed lost two points.
Harry gazed at the ground with tears in his eyes; he had hoped his feelings were well-guarded at Hogwarts.
She was gonna neuter my cat when it was a kitten. She came in and said, "That's an awesome cat you have there". A couple days later she said, "He's getting neutered tonight, that's a really great cat you have here".
Its not like Im in a position of power or anything.  They just think it sounds good that its a problem and they just want someone to notice because they know that when it's all said and done it'll end up ok.   And I'm not sure
His broom gave a few new skills.
Go on then try to do the same with your friends who got banned.  Get banned.  Do the same thing to them.  Get banned again.  Stop playing the game and watch a streamer play it.  Get banned again.  This is the
Harrywatched the goblin on tv.
The forest was black when I found it, just as it will always be.
They showed Harry and his friends leaving school for the summer. I was so excited. I just assumed they would return with the entire school
Wow he added blinking animation
They half walked half ran
Oh move over Hermione!  Here comes the Queen of Hogwarts!
They tugged and heaved at the plastic and rope but the chain never let go.
While people were still playing in the middle east, a bunch of them died fighting in ww2...
Harry said You fancy. Harry and Gilly said We fancy.  That means it is them. Gilly has had the hots for him since S1 I believe.
Why isnt he coming down?
Instead he said as he got up and threw my beer can at my head. He didn't really care though.
Hagrid made them tea!
All right then. I'm gonna give you an A for effort. But you're only giving them an A because their are no other options.   Edit: I can't believe this is getting downvoted.
I think it must have been like that a while ago. Now it has been disabled.  You need to turn it on in the settings for "add game shortcuts to Steam", and you have to keep it on.  You can't do it automatically.
And its really thanksgiving tomorrow.   So many things going on on thanksgiving that arent important but arent forgotten to be enjoyed.
Howling with pain the night before? I've never had a dog do that before. If he's in pain it'll be easier to tell. I take mine to the vet the day of an exam and get them to weigh them for me.
Harry sat and thought that it was silly of his father to worry about this much.
Your platform should be able to render 2D images, it's not going to be able to render 3D graphics.    Is there a way to force it to render the 3D image?
So this time when is the next election?
This was supposed to be about the game but now I’m curious about the book
Im Harry Harry Potter. I don't know who you are and your life, so don't tell me.
You cant go to a private college without paying more than the total cost of attendance.
Ron ceased his tapping.
I think Im still in the dark on all that. What is the most you could get for the striker cert?
The whole house smelled of pot when I got home.
All right he said he would do it.
Use it well the next day, it works like a charm.
Sirius told me about the problem today and has asked to keep an eye out. They were able to determine that the issue is hardware related which the repair guy will look into when he gets here tomorrow. I'm hoping this isn't the beginning of the end.
Then the little lane will be wide enough for everyone!
IHermione Im sorryI didnt mean to steal your ideaI didnt know I had done anything like this beforeAndI didnt want to be rude about itI love yours
And the sword said "It is my job to kill the darkness".
Like Filchs ling cabinets?
bellowed the Death Eater who had been the one to make the fatal mistake of going to the Dark Side.
Harry was almost glad to leave his bedroom, but for some reason he felt something was different. It took a while for his mind to realize what it was that had him so uneasy. He had heard some odd noises outside. What was his father doing at this hour of
Her mione youre a freak and youll die before i let you kill off everyone else
The stands erupted it was awesome. He and the crowd went absolutely bananas at the end when they went up again.   I'm from New Zealand originally but was at the game and loved it. I remember when that was the last time the NZ national team played in
At this Neville let out a loud fart that blew dust everywhere.
Professor McGonagall had come back? What have I been doing with my life?
The Seven Potters Were Created To Make The People Happy
Thank goodness Ginny whispered. He's such a scowl of pain and rage. Ron would beat his ass.
No one tells me what to do.
He dropped a locket that looked suspiciously like the one that was in the house, so we have to assume they are tied together somehow.
You she whispered gazing into his eyes? You said to go back to your place, you gave him your room number. You wanted to keep your room but you're scared, that maybe he'll try to get in somehow. So what happened? He didn't call to
Then she suddenly smiled. "How was your afternoon?"
The side of his head was blown off, yet he was "only" shot in the shoulder, neck, jaw, and back. Jesus fucking Christ.   What the hell happened, I wonder?
A mixture but to get a good idea you can do some googling. What do you want to know specifically?   I've had both IEMs that are super thin and the sound is very poor, I've had ones that are really thick and they
But Death was cunning. He was a sly man. I don't know if the people of Nazareth understood that.
There was something strange about the way his body was moving.
And my names Malfoy!
However I shall answer I will not hide, for fear of my country's fall
Ron got back ou of the closet and I'm a bit worried
Oh yes Harry I think that's it.
Walking back from the pub with a girlfriend and some old mates on Sunday morning and the guy who I had to explain "what was so bad about Manchester United? "was a Liverpool fan and was shocked and said "we won all the trophies in England"
I wont blast people when they're on fire, I wont blast people when they're dying.   I'm guessing that's not what you meant.
Oh ImIm sorry. Please be patient. I have a feeling you'll see this message in a few hours or the day after. This post has been removed for not being a [TIDAL SALE] and because this is a [TIDAL] post.
Harry could see it and felt no compassion and couldnt believe it.  The moment he was going to do it, the moment he saw the death eater's soul, the moment he would have his hands on it and make a wish that it would kill him, it
The moment the Minister for Science and Technology said "I understand" and "there's nothing else you want to say" was when he had lost the argument.
What did you say to him? I just met him for the first time the other day and I don't want to offend him.
On the contrary he is a real hero. He has done more for the world in the last year than most of the people in this sub can ever imagine. He's done more for humanity than anyone ever will.
Well done said Dumbledore!
Rons Auntie Muriel was my favourite. She was sooooo much fun
HAVE YOU GONE MAD!?
They had not drawn a final decision, said a government source, adding that a decision was likely to come on Monday.
Miss Granger with Kingsley, is it
Youd think if he had the energy to make a reddit post he could have the energy to finish that game.     On a serious note you could have won with that last kill.
At the start of the article, she says this is how Trump was elected:  >In its final analysis, Democrats' argument that the 2016 election was stolen through Russian involvement should be judged by the actions of the American people, not the actions of one individual.

She was wearing a dress.  He was in jeans.  He was carrying a suitcase.  Why would he not just tell her he was carrying a suitcase?
As they couldnt go on the pitch for the first game because their legs were fucked, it is probably better not to have to risk having your players hurt again. So far they've done better than Liverpool.
So where do you stand on the subject of evolution, and why do you disagree with your mother-in-law?
I hope youre right...i need it lol
They seemed to have missed the part of the article where she did not want to talk to him at all.
he wouldnever ever forget where he's from, and his family and everything he has ever experienced
He was humming merrily to himself as he went down the hall. "I'm happy, I'm happy, I'm happy."
Happy birthday Harry she deserves a great one 🎂🎈
Not fast enough said the guys standing around looking at the camera.
Anything to get rid of the god awful default keyboard
Three handpainted signs had been placed in the parking lot of the Walgreens at 8400 South State Road 42 at the intersection of U.S. Highway 287 and Interstate 95. The sign was a picture of an old-fashioned billboard, with a photograph of a man
Well youve just had 2 of the best teams in the league go 0-2 in one day. I dont get how people think theres any bias against them lol. Especially this sub and r/nba, its just a matter of "oh they lost, everyone
A bald man in a green suit and tie and a bald woman in a green suit and a gray suit with black-colored glasses stand behind the screen, talking.
She closed the door before you could put your arms around her. She’s not worth the risk.
A door stood ajar, in the hall of the small mansion in which they had been living for four weeks in peace and solitude, and they could not resist the temptation of slipping in and looking out.
Id take tip from someone thats made a lot of money. How you think they do it?
Whats the YouKnowWhat in the middle?
Standing on either side of me.
What on earth were the people in those pics thinking?
Harry moved an old, large file into my desk drawer. A couple of photos, some old letters, his handwritten notes and the file itself. He said, 'I need you to find out what we're going to do about you, I need to know what
I tried to kill myself this year and honestly I think I can't anymore. I know that no one will miss me, that no one will ever like me and that I can't change that. All my thoughts are just stuck in here, where the sun doesn't
Harry Im sure James will do a video on this.
Grab brooms from the bottom shelf near the food court?
Yes we have been.  He was doing a lot of that for a good while.  Not anymore.
Youre lucky you werent on a mission and were running as fast as possible when the truck rolled over. Could have been so much worse.
That does it said that, we have lost the ability to be creative
Barely breathing he stared around, his eyes focused on the floor as if he could feel a presence standing behind him. At first he could see nothing, just grey walls, so cold they made him shiver. He closed his eyes but couldn’t sleep.
Snow crunched beneath his boots, the white flakes falling over the trees and landing on his jacket and jeans.
Ron lagging a little?
He turned his back to the camera and gave a thumbs up
The whole crowd was chanting “No justice, no peace,” and I was like, “Hey, that’s a pretty good theme song.”
Why hadnt Dumbledore told anyone about the horcruxes for years.   Also what were Harrys reasons for going to get horcruxes?
Finally Hermione asked stiyce to kill him
Behind both of the guys is the same person (I just checked his twitter), so that’s probably the reason
If its a symbol for you its a good symbol. Its better that way than to be associated with some weird religion you dont know.   The "I'm a Christian, my religion is the truth" people need to stop.   The people who like that
Of course none of you could find them. I think the fact that he didn’t say they were lost or hidden might be a good clue.
She looked close to tears as she spoke of her brother's death and told the jury there was no chance of his being alive today.
No sign of her. It'll be a while.
Spray from the high volume can with the bottle top off and spray through.
This way Voldemort will always be more powerful.
And his scream was amazing.
A few of the things in that article made me cringe.  >"the fact that people even believe there is a possibility of a god is not only evidence of a serious mental health condition, it also speaks volumes about the level of sophistication and depth of thought that is
From it he removed the time frame, I think he’s fine.
You Harry Dedalus continued to improve at the expense of all those around him?
He had no idea what he was doing when he said to the team that he could see that things were not going to work out. And that was coming from an actual team leader, someone who has helped them through a whole season.
Hermione crawled out from underneath the bed. Her clothes were torn and her sheets were damp. She was wearing just a pair of black stockings, her bare legs exposed. She smiled back at Ron, "Just got myself a nice meal after work. Would you like to
Uncle Vernon didnt go away.  Just got bored of farming for stuff.
he was gettin more and more aggressive with his style to say the least.  he was still trying to act like he was in a video game in terms of how he moved and used his sword.  when you do a "melee" play style it's not
Cant you bring us your friend code? Its not on you that its broken.
Ron lay back down in the chair, then picked up his phone and answered. “Hello?”
The pairs will be in 2 packs of 4 and the packs will come with 4 packs of a total of 6 pairs. I thought that was pretty obvious.
Merry ChristmasHey look Harrys family tree is differentThis year is different from past
Deciding the trees would fit the park was not easy.
It was ashame but I loved his story. He was the only character that didn't die on the show. I think that makes him my favorite from the books.
She was standing with her back turned to the camera the whole time though. She was even walking with her legs folded.
Heaps of little bronze fish...
Xeno philius frowned hiss and shook his head.
Wheres Hedwig Harry she was so fucking cute. But that's not fair how do you forget her when you have the ultimate gay lover
The smiling face of death in the upper right corner is so disturbing.
Harry didnt know whether the child would be good or evil. The only certainty was that she wasnt gonna be good as she wasnt even born yet. But when he got to the orphanage she didnt care about anything so he knew she would end up being a good
Hagrid who had sat next to the window of the compartment was looking out at the city, his wand was raised and he was waving wildly.
He put on a pretty good show against Jones, he's just such a great boxer. He should definitely come back.
I recognize him from a YouTuber I use to watch named "bryan_s" or something like that. He usually plays with a very strange style, especially from what I've seen (I only know of him for a year or so), and that's
You know how much I love the fact that you put "L" instead of "M"?
They hadhardly fluttered out of the wind, and they were still.
Ron stared around the room.
He knew at once that her feelings for him, at that moment, had been the strongest of any of the girls that had so lately joined him on the road.
Was this normal cat behavior or an attempt at a photobomb? It's so hard to tell sometimes.
Harry this isnt a movie.
Chapter Harry Kreacher doesnt even mention him ever again in canon. I would be very surprised if in the canon of ASOIAF the name KAINE does ever surface again, let alone if that one character is still alive.
An as fer that are good and as a great as. As good as they possibly. As a great as it possible.
Quite gaga these days.
They leaned out of the window of a moving taxi, in the middle of the streets of a Mexican town on Sunday, to see how fast a car could go.

All you have to do is make the same mistake twice.  The only way to fix it is to do it again.  Repeat until you're comfortable.    There are more, but it would take me a while to write it all down.
The planets have been discovered by two separate teams, led by scientists from the University of Bristol and using the European Space Agency's Kepler spacecraft.
However there can be some downsides:
How strange it was that someone on the train was saying “oh we have to go the opposite way” and we thought “okay what way”   Now we know.
I knowbut how did you get it?
Muggles whove just been exposed to magic, or people who haven't done any magic. Or anyone who is trying to take their power away with a wand. Or anyone.

Smoke kept furling out in the distance as the train crawled along. For a minute or two it was quiet, save for the distant clunk of wheels. Then the whistle blew.
Well have to risk it to get it?
The lighted dial ofDudleys is not the brightest. However,the dial looks very good.There are no complications on this watch.I find that a bit unfortunate.I really liked the movement on the Sinn D1 and would have liked to see that included on the D1
Chapter Harry felt a little lightheaded, for some unknown reason.
Harry Dumbledore didnt want to fuck Hermione?
Finally as nobody seemed to be talking about it, we have a new episode of Dragon Ball Z Kai with the new Kai Kai, King Kai. This episode was great and definitely got me excited to get back to the show.
I mean Cat termoles are probably the best example of this.   He has done well, but he wasn't really talked about much until after. We weren't even sure if he'd be a starter by this time.
Shhh hissed Professor McGonagall.

Hagrid had honored the memory of the late, great Dumbledore.
So why in the hell did they decide to put a giant cross above the stadium? Because, it's a place to pray.
Delicately made models of your favorite characters, made of acrylic and acrylic cement. This kit includes both bases, base and paint, a new 3-foot square foam cube and 1 foot square acrylic sheet (optional but recommended). For Ages 8+
You and Hagrid were both in The Prisoner of Azkaban, right?
Some had merely signed on, and were given an email for guidance. Others joined the party in December, or February, or later.
All right dear well then you should know that I am an adult and not a child.

It was worse than we thought.
Thats exactly the sort of thing i did. You shouldnt really have much issue finding people with a mic, they dont have to be all that good. However, you will need a mic if you are playing with premades.
The babble died away.Another was born.The child's eyes grew wide in awe.
They had tied for first at the start of the season, but after a poor start the Tigers dropped the series in Baltimore. Then, as has been the case over the last few years, the Orioles won 15 of the next 17. The two teams have now split four
No it isnt said.
After opening his mouth like that, I think he could be the next great comedian.
Harry wondered what their parents thought of him, a guy that was just as much a kid as they were.
Caution murmured it could be a fake, but not sure.
They were whispering excitedly while they were taking these photos, that seems pretty clear.
Looks like a harp seal.  They are beautiful animals and have the largest mouths of any species.
Do you understand me?
If Dumbledore didnt tell Snape his feelings he would of ended up losing himself and becoming a mindless wand-wielding monster that killed people and caused all kinds of trouble.
Harry noticed him glance at him and smiled.  "Hey there, good to see you!"
Dumbledore must have taught them all there lesson.
It felt as though the final third in the league against Barcelona was missing something crucial. When it comes to performances in this competition, there is nothing that is more depressing than seeing a team playing well but not putting it all together in the final third of the field. However
As Harry moved aside from the door, the door opened up, and a tall, handsome man stepped through.
Those whose clothes are too small.   A lot of them make the most out of that, but that's not an attractive quality.
II want to go to the beach. It's been raining non-stop for two weeks. Just a few days ago, it stopped raining at night for three days straight. I haven't felt like going to the beach in weeks.

Then the young witch must die in the act of killing her child. In other words, when the witch dies, it's not because she's evil, it's because of her child's curse.
So its you is it?  I don't think I've ever seen you before.
Fred and George had been living on the side of the road for almost a year, when Fred became sick one day. He didn't want to see his dog die like that, so he made plans. George said, "Let's go live on the beach!" Fred
Im up front the fact you have a dog is cool. But then you post in r/aww
Snape Yeah yer not, Ron
Then they heard a gunshot and fell to the ground, but not before catching a glimpse of a stranger.  He shot at them from his truck, as their friends ran to see what was happening.
They walked past a small black and white dog, he had a large bulge under his collar and looked around like he might jump you.
We thought you had lost me, I thought you had lost me,
Ron glanced at Hermione.  'I believe there was something you forgot to add there' he said.
I suppose weve got the last of our top tier players now, and who knows what else will happen by now, but at this point, I'm more surprised that we didn't go after DeMarcus Cousins after his contract year. I guess we didn't see him as
Exotic owers and bewitched. Can't get a gg on either but it was still a fun fight.
Someone helped us. And thanks to him the game is actually playable now and is fun to play. There are some bugs that need to be fixed (notably the camera bug) and other stuff but it's playable. It's great to see this happening. And the
Men have wasted away in the process
Regulus was instantly recognizable, having had his eyes gouged out, but was then quickly replaced with a green-and-black humanoid. He carried himself in a stiff, formal manner. He wore a black trench coat, purple shirt, blue pants, and purple shoes.
What about that tea tho...
The giant chuckled darkly.Yet a little fear was in his eyes,for he could not let her die so easily.The giant was a master of the dark arts,and was master at killing too.He had seen many deathless beings before,and one of them was the
He punched it with his left hand, right?
Looking rather alarmed the whole time
Ducking down they joined him
Thanks he said taking the pic on his camera phone. It just shows how stupid some of these people are
No agreed Ron.  But the current situation is the most embarrassing since a long long time.  It makes no sense for our country to waste money on a futile war that will never end.   Obama must get out of Iraq right now.  We can not
He teaches Potions but I think he was talking more about potions of the art of elven persuasion.
Hagrid dropped the teapot. The wand didn't hit, Harry didn't get hit
Theyd gotten the idea that we are all gay men, from our past. Then once we had realized it wasnt true we'd try to pass ourselves off as lesbians and they'd have a mental breakdown.
Harrys voice was high as hell, it sounded like a man talking to himself. I've always felt like that voice just sounds better when he doesn't have to say anything.
It wasnt a question. But, if you like the movie. I suggest watching it in 4K. The bluray isn’t the best, especially with this movie but it doesn’t take away from it.
Although owls normally hunt near their nests, there were three exceptions.    One:  The eagles caught a rabbit on the porch and had it stuffed, then gave it to their wife.    Two:  They spotted a mouse in the attic and
I know Ron snapped.  I don't think he snapped at himself and didn't care about his own life and well-being.    I think he snapped when he was thinking about not being responsible enough to do his job.  And now he's a martyr
He has had to make many adjustments as a rookie, a new scheme, a new playbook.  It's only natural for him to get frustrated
A short way ahead of you, but I bought one.  I'm actually interested to see if it's more effective/effective than just my regular sunscreen, but I have no skin to test it on.
Harry here Hermione was my biggest weakness.
And have you really considered a divorce?
As there is little to no evidence suggesting that the NSA was gathering emails of people other than Clinton during the primary season, we're all really confused how it became so big of an issue that Clinton herself had to take to the front page to defend herself against it.
You fed DracoMalfoy some cookies?  Who do you think you are?  ^I'm ^salt ^about ^the ^no ^banana.
After a minute or two of sitting on the couch...  "Oh... you're just looking at a picture of some girl."  *hugs the dog and stares directly at picture* "Sorry."
Harry shuffled miserably off to the bathroom to fill his cup from the bathroom sink. He then looked at his mug and found himself completely surprised by what he found there.
Also with Mr. Ronald's money, there's a chance that he could be a super villain. The money could just be a plot point and he just has a bunch of money, but there's definitely a possibility that he is a major villain
Uncle Vernon nearly crashed the boat when he realized he was trying to play DnD with a sword and a shield. But, he was able to get it out after much yelling and the rest of the characters.   When Aunt Ethel was upset because the kids
The Dark Lord did not allow.
Not a wizard eh?
A Muggle said Hagrid was the best.  A Muggle said Harry Potter was amazing.  I could go on, but I'm sure you get the idea.  And yes, I read them too!
Everyone was silent staring in the direction of their phone when he took this photo.
He watched Voldemorts white death video?
Dominating the scene was a dream come true for us. I believe we have built the best CSGO team in history and that the team will go on to be the greatest in the future. We know all the people who have worked on the team and have supported the team
So if you seek to find that which is beyond your ability, you become something that transcends what exists?  So then you cannot find God.
We know Olivers speech has been re-recorded so there should be a different one
Its no wonder I was a terrible basketball player at high school, if I had only known how to drive off the backboard I'd have been a star.
Whats he doing Harry!? You could get it for $10 on a craigslist!
He always sp spoils it in the very end like "Haha that guy can't read. That's why he keeps asking me for the things". That is why. I still enjoyed the hell out of that game though, not to mention the awesome music :)
Dumbledore however was choosing to kill Voldemort because Voldemort was a threat to Harry's continued existence.
I couldnt understand why he has to use a throwaway for his personal information. He even says he is not sure that he is still a virgin. This is so weird to me.
Come on lets get some pictures of those fangames up! The more the merrier.
So how did the mods find out who it was?
Privately Harry felt shed a tear or two when he spoke about her death, the last in a series of deaths that had brought the family to this sad point in time. He, his father and his brothers had been separated from each other for over four years and now,
Harry suddenly realized that it was possible to be a wizard without turning into a cocky cunt. He was actually surprised, considering his past. The boy wizard felt a tinge of embarrassment.
Hermione buried her face in her hands again. "I'm so sorry, Dumbledore. I know I should not have been on that list. It was a mistake. I promise I won't let it happen again."
proud and very domineering. He was often on top of me and would get really into it. I really like how he made me feel like my pussy was the only thing i could have
There was so much going on it's hard to believe
All right Ill spit my answer.  Why? Because when the US started the Iraq War, they were all in on it. Now a days, they are not.
Chapter Of course I know, but I always just skip that, and skip the second half of the episode entirely.
Hermione made purple and blue dye and she was supposed to dye her hair blue for the birthday party. The only people who knew it was purple were Ron, Hermione and Ron's cousin Sirius.
At last it seemed the last days of the War against Drugs were at an end. But as many have already noted, that was only the beginning. The Bush administration had no intention of allowing the war to end, so it kept a massive drug operation intact—the  
It could be somewhere on the border where the two are being mixed.  Not sure if the new maps would affect that though.

So weve given a bunch of good teams the choice between playing us at the moment and our playoff schedule.  But at least now we know how teams view us.
The doors opened and a man in a dark suit wearing a grey beret stood outside.   "How may we help you sir?"
As Harry closed the door, he caught a whiff of something he hadn't realised he'd taken for granted. The old familiar odor. This was it, the scent of a life. For one moment, he hesitated, then he realized that there was something else in the
NoIof course not said the former chairman of the Republican establishment, who in the early stages of the Iraq War had to say, “We didn’t go to war because we had information that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.” (NoIof
He squeezed through it.
Perhaps Snape had left the Order's "council of life" and joined the Aurors?  You could see him working for them instead of the Order, but working against them nonetheless.  Also, I think he was more than a little jealous of how much
But where have you been?
You reckon this is the real deal?
And then what does the left side have...
Goblinmade armor does not work on the sword, but it does work on the sword's hands. So yes, it is possible.
We may never know, if anyone knows anything they can please inform me.
To his surprise Hagrid took the paper out of his hands, read it thoroughly, and then put it back into his hand.
Harry raised his wand and made Harry face the ground...
he whispered and the voice isnt mine, I heard it when I was asleep.
Outside butteries and bees is where it's at.  Also, if you're driving in from the eastside, you've got a lot to learn if you're going to take the 405 south to LA, then take the 110 south to the westside.  But
The rat was still on board.
He yelled at five people not to follow him on Facebook for no apparent reason?   I wonder if he had an excuse for why he was on Facebook?
Harry jumped he had a gun pointed at him and was on the floor
Oh how wonderful squealed with delight at the sight of the new set of books and the new cover!
Weve got to stay ahead of the rest of the league.
I just wish Idiocracy would take it one step further.  Idiocracy, Idiocracy, Idiocracy.  Idiocracy: The End of the World.   I feel for this guy.
Harry ran forward and held open the door, but he was so intent on getting away from Ron and Hermione and the Dursleys that he didn’t realize that he was opening the door for the other man. He didn’t have the strength to hold
But as I say... I don't want to make my blog the focus of my life in any way and I have no intention of doing that. If you want to talk to me, you can email me at cathywf (at) yahoo (dot
Harry paused in the middle of his thought, looking up to the ceiling of the cavern, its pitch black interior glowing softly in the moonlight. It seemed to have a strange kind of beauty, almost as though it were enchanted.
Its horrible isnt it? I get so little from my body.
He did as she asked. And she went ahead and sent him on a date to give her a chance to ask him out...  But the thing is, is that you don't date anyone if you don't want to be the one to ask them out... I
The Dursleys who had their magical muggle dad and magical mum (and probably a number of other wizards as well).   And then they have all their other wizard relatives, which includes their Uncle Petey, Auntie Filch and Uncle Vernon. And Aunt Petunia

Ron and Hermione now have something special. An understanding, and a strong friendship.

He was worried that his job as an assistant coach had run out of time.
As he crossed the stage to the opening number “I Have Nothing,” the president looked around the crowd of Republican supporters and found no one that seemed as out of his comfort zone as himself. “I will give you a prediction,” the candidate
He wondered when was he gonna get to be a good shot like that.
Is there such a thing as a "good girl" fetish?
Harry leaned forward. “Let me get this straight. You think this was a good idea? I’ve been studying your species for over two years now. You never learned how to control your power until after we rescued you.”
He bolted his dinner there, then made himself a nice fire. After making coffee, he returned to his home, but he didn’t see anyone at his house. When he checked the outside, he saw that the wind had whipped up an even bigger storm.
Evidently it is not.
Catching the look on your husband's face... You're lucky enough to have someone with you that cares.
No deal said Ronit Agarwal after the second Test match in Dharamsala. He also suggested that a combination of two spinners could do wonders.
It just gave him so much hype because this guy was awesome in the film.
Phineas Nigellus raised supercilious gluteus maximus (above) against a wall. It was a case in point. He then removed the head. But he left in his place a small piece of hair, which he used to wipe his privates when they became wet,
Another few seconds and I would start laughing.
He was vaguely familiar and there was nothing in the way of identifying markings on his face. The other two males seemed equally human. Perhaps they were twins, or brothers. But, then again, there could be just one.
In fact he wasnt a complete failure, that's a lie, he went to a good school and still scored 1,5/2/3 on the SAT, he also didn't get in to med school, so no, he was not a complete failure.
Were they Death Eaters though? I'm not too sure what those are.
Then a pain like you've never felt came upon her that no one could predict. She suddenly had to fight and win in a game no one thought she would have to play. Then she was able to play again and win it all, and it was the happiest moment
This dreadful conside brawl, where you get to kill one of your own people, that was the worst one out of all of them. It was just bad.
Yer ticket fer Hogwarts!
Maybe Peeves let it happen?
Hagrid who didnt understand he wasnt an animagus and didnt have the will to get back up after that, he was a wand weilding, albino, not a good guy.
It seemed she had a point.
With his parents and brother still alive, it seems like there are several others that had an easier time to keep themselves alive than to continue helping Luffy, considering they would have needed to kill themselves.
She read it then she saw it and she said "You've lost it".
The cross section of an object from the perspective of an observer is generally a three-dimensional plane of depth. In conventional perspective-projected imaging, a camera projects rays of light along the x, y, and z axes onto a view-screen and records the image
Even the endless raindrops seemed like a good excuse to get away from the school and spend some time with the rest of the team. In the end, it was too dangerous out there to do much more than stand around and talk, but the way we had the conversation

Thats the Portkey. If you look closely you will notice that the door it self is not connected to an actual door, it just looks like it because it's shaped like that.
Kreacher tried everything everything. He was a good cop. He was also evil. He had no moral compass, and was just trying to stay alive.
Now the last member of the team with no interest in any of the sports.
She was frowning at you. She was smiling at a different dog. You can't read minds or psychics, just like you can't read their minds. Just look at the dog's body language.
Right follow me but I've got a question for you. Why do people have the idea that you should get all of the champions. In the first place you shouldn't. You should just go free to play so you can try all the champs you want and pick
The twins grins turned to something quite... scary... when he first showed them the "cage". I don't even want to think about what that feels like!
Harry read thestory again. He then gave the book back to the man and said “please read this.” He told him to open the book and then read chapter seven. He then turned back to Ginny and said, “Do you remember last time we read
This note was sticking with me. It was from a person I thought was a friend. After reading it for the first time, I realized, of course, it was NOT my friend. It took me a while to realize what it was that had happened. I knew

As the door creaked open with a metallic click, I felt a sharp pain under my thumb and finger. I was sure I’d broken it. But there were no wounds, no blackened skin. I was still alive, after all, and I could easily

The buildings on either side of the street have really bad texture quality.  It would be like a picture of a person taking a picture of a brick.   I'm not saying I think your idea is bad.  It might actually look decent.  What do

Well said Quirrell impatiently. He's so good at playing the role of being exasperated, but once the situation is right for him to make a statement, he makes the most of it.

Hermione closed the book. She was sitting on a bench, reading a book about the magical community. Her wand was in her hand, and she stared into the fire that was burning near the bench. Ron put his arm around her waist as she read.
So he asked for and was given a new battery. The battery is good, but it doesn't work.

The Sstands for Selwyn.  I love it.  Just like Selwyn.
He prodded moodily at the little bird that had perched on his shoulder and then, as if by magic, was gone.
Maybe he was imagining something, maybe he was just being polite, probably both.  No way to know.
Silence fell and Harry’s brows furrowed.
He was afraid that if he talked about the new rules, then the game would be a lot more difficult than it already was for him. You were right when you said that in the long run, it is the right thing to do, he's just too used to

The Sorting Ceremonys about to start?
Hams and pheasants were the commonest of the wild game species hunted, and were particularly sought after. The number of birds killed in the course of a single hunting season were so high that it was thought that the game population in Cornwall was decimated, and the animals were

The snake suddenly opened its eyes, but the creature stayed perfectly still, its eyes and nostrils still shut.
The one thing weve learned from this is that the next 2 weeks are going to be crazy. No rest for the wicked! We all know what is coming, and we also know who will take it down.

Thank you said Leesburg, VA.
Beneath this was a little bit of truth, which is why it has gotten under my skin.   I know I've come a long way, and I'll continue to come a long way until I finally don't need to feel the need to justify anything.

Dumbledore raised his hand. "What you are suggesting is that the wizarding community will take responsibility for the crimes of the Dark Lord. I do not want such a thing. I do not wish to be forced to kill innocent people."

Well as long as it isn't something with that much exposure and money attached it probably isn't going to be too big of a deal. I would be worried if he actually got a big deal in other places and he did worse or made worse comments that his actions affected
Would it be okay if someone else in the community did the analysis, and that person would make the post, as long as it includes a link to your post?

Harry I dont think will be that happy with being forced into a new role because he wont get his role back

People are being downright disrespectful by suggesting the best way to handle things on this thread.  As far as I am concerned he is still being a little whiny and immature, but at the same time I can understand that you might feel that way about his behaviour after what
he kept saying.   >If your a white boy. then you are at least half white.  and  >If your an American then you are white  and  >If your a black kid. then you are a black.  >If your white
And he clicked the button too.  I'd rather he did a quick check of the comments before actually clicking.
But how do you know he had a gun?
How was he supposed to know? They don't even know yet, so I don't think anything is off the table. He didn't even say anything about being afraid. Just not a smart idea, at all.
They were passing through the woods to the top of the hill behind the village and the trees on that side were not very tall so it was hard for them to see the people on the hill in the other direction.
Somewhere in Hogsmeade suggested the name "Alderney" and then it was changed to "Arrowood" and then "Hogsmeade" later.
The supporting poles are actually just one piece, no? Just the wooden part
The speaker was a little rough... not worth the price for me.
Comets look flashy but do they work?
But I wonder why the hell the person had the gun pointed at him. Was this in another part of the country/state?
They climbed in Hagrid's tree, and the next thing I knew, I was laying in Hagrid's arms.

Very slowly hardly daring to move forward. But then she felt the touch of his fingers caressing her, the feel of him soft hands holding onto her. She would have to take it slow, because her arms felt as if they could take no more and she had to
Everywhere Harry went people looked. It was the middle of a blizzard and the world was frozen into a state of shock and utter despair.
this was what Harry looked like in his prime
Of course you couldnt just take that out of the game

The snow in the winter sucks.  I can't wait till summer.

Transfiguration is some of my favorite stuff, it’s a bit of a departure from the rest of the book series but I love it and I love the story being told with the perspective of an older Harry.
So now they had a reason for not being included in the game then!
Look when we three have a date we go to the beach and then hang out on the sand, we all know what happened to her.   If you really want to get her back you should go on a beach date with a small amount of alcohol in you.

Dumbledore he said dashing.   We never got to see Hagrid as much. He said, I'm busy.   It was a pretty good excuse for not having Hagrid as much. He was busy with Umbridge.
Hermione Hmm Ive been in love with Hermione since her first appearance in the first Harry Potter book and in the books it seemed like I had never really gotten over her. I have never seen another girl whose been so attractive to me. I guess it's because the books had

Harry edged between her thighs to take her lips into his mouth. The kiss was sweet and wet, but it was a short kiss. "This was what I'd have you do for me every night."
Perhaps that was why the FBI had to break into her emails.  I'm assuming they were trying to find something in them.  If not, why not?  Isn't it just common practice to have evidence for these things?    Maybe it was simply

They wanted Dumbledore ferreted out, and they didn't get that.
Harry could think of a more perfect gift for his wife to open up the new year on. It's such a sexy gift that he didn't mind the teasing.

But Dumbledore would have said he didn’t think the prophecy could come true. No?
Once the caf e.e. had been paid for in full,

His voice tailed away and he sighed deeply, a deep sadness in his voice that spoke of a long lost soul and the loss that it had brought.
You will have classes. And you will be bored out of your mind. But if you go to a different school than your friends at least you will find out what other people are doing and making fun of it too.

It shouldnt be too hard but it looks like your gonna need to start at about 5-800 mg and then increase the dose every month or so or else it may get super uncomfortable.  But it could work, it usually does when i take sermones.
Snape was holding his wand like a gun, and you're not a fan of a weapon with a deadly magical power.
Dumbledore now became very well known.

Nobody could open it. The card is so damaged
Harry had almost forgotten about the girl, but when he saw a familiar smile on her face he remembered. He smiled back and nodded to the girl and smiled some more before she turned to go.

Snape had seen to it that Voldemort was not punished because it was a "blood oath" Voldemort swore to Voldemort's father that he would be "protected" as long as he lived. Killing him would have broken that oath.

So Death picked up an enemy from the dead, and he can heal it. In fact, he's supposed to be a healing mage in the movie! Maybe he has a sort of magic that can heal?  Also, I think the title for the movie is:

Albus was beside himself, “What should I do with my left hand?!”

In fact Im quite confident that in a year he will start complaining about the lack of players at the club.

He was starting to get back to that old form.  He hasn't played for so long, and he has lost all motivation.  You know that feeling after you've been up and down for some time, it starts to feel impossible to keep it up.
I suppose you think I should just leave them? I just think they'll probably take a chunk out of my savings if I leave them with the money for a long period of time.   If I can't make it up to them with them, am I better

I suppose it helps some of the people whose lives are on the line are less likely to feel offended and look at it as you are being a douche.  Maybe, just maybe, we shouldn't be so quick to judge others as douches.
Poor bloke said Ronin wasn't a good movie.

Finally Uncle Ver nonchalantly mentions that he saw the baby as one of his own. He did not say who the father was, I just thought it was a weird choice that they never even mentioned.
In the end they were all doomed anyway.
Potter said Snape suddenly. He has to do so when he knows he is going to die.      I agree with your choice of Dumbledore.
Brightly colored gures were really popular, I remember playing around on the early ones a lot. You could draw the outline of the word by cutting it out of the plastic, then color it in.

His mother and father are both named Mark. Mark is a common middle name and as such is not unusual in Irish families. If that isn't enough of a clue, you don't have an uncommonly Irish name to begin with.

Even Aunt Petunia didnt know the difference.
Above what Harry assumed, and with what little comfort, he found himself.  Even if he did not know why, his heart was sick.  He had no right to be angry with his cousin, but the fact that the latter had been left behind as though he

Harry glanced down at the small knife in her hand. "The real danger is in the air, dear. I'm not trying to kill you. I'm just trying to get you out safely."

Something fluid and silvery like oil. Looks like something to do with a pore. Is that possible?
No actually said Hermione.      And this is because she's a character I genuinely find appealing.      She's smart and good at school and her parents aren't exactly well off but they do seem pretty happy.

Dad said everyone from his childhood loved to play the same game, so he wanted to give his kids something similar. It turned out to be the best decision he's ever made. It's only 3 player, but it still turns the game around.
The vast majority of people who are pro-war don't see a conflict with Israel. Just because the US is involved, it doesn't mean that Israel is getting attacked. If Israel was attacked by some random country, there would be uproar, not pro-war.

This question has also been asked but the answer is yes. As far as I know, there's no way to save them.
We swore when we were kids that we wouldn't have sex until the rest of our families are gone. We still won't.
Harry couldnt sit down. Not that he's sitting down.
Seconds later Harry realized why the woman looked like a giant mole.
Harry hesitated then headed into the bathroom to brush his teeth, the shower was empty, but the water he was accustomed to. He closed his eyes as the warm water touched his skin, it made his skin feel better.
This way Harry mouthed an expression like he was having a great time and you could be sure that he was a nice fellow and it was actually because he was on drugs rather than just because he was bored.
Harry glanced over at the small screen, just long enough to notice that some of the names had changed. 'Is your name changing?'
Hedwig Hedwig But the real question is, do they sing The Cat in the Hat?
Ill explain it back to you when im not on mobile.  Its like any other skill, you can learn, improve and grow. If you cant make any progress youre doing it wrong.   The trick is finding out what youre doing wrong, not doing
The one who said 'I will not let you be alone'

Fleur walked over to Aiden, resting her forehead against his, looking up at him with tired eyes. "I'm glad you didn't kill me."
said Harry and when I said I was in I immediately saw a small room, he said he didn't have a lot of money and that was the problem.
So the Elder Wand should still count as part of Voldemort's family since they share a single ancestor.
He had just saved the whole world
Harry rubbed his forehead and his forehead was already wet.
It took quite a while for the world to start up again.
Harry said Hermione again.  That was all I needed to see to know Hermione is a piece of shit
Could I could I use this on YouTube?  It's my wallpaper I would be forever grateful

Why dont we go all the way and just burn all the books that were written by people who have actually never seen a black person?
Harry looked closer. "Dumbass, that's not how it works."
His brain itself seemed a little off this game too. I've noticed him making questionable decisions more often, sometimes just for the sake of being questionable decisions.
Voldemort caught up with Dumbledore, and then, the book of Lestrange.
There were once three men:
Chapter When the Patronuses are Met
He himself darted around the area.
You told me the name of the song. "The Dark Side of the Moon"
He had the nasty gout attack that he had a month ago and could barely move. He's been playing through it the last month or so, so I wouldn't say he's at 100% health.
They had spent the morning getting caught up and the afternoon enjoying the view and relaxing with some beers and BBQ food.
With a wave to the sky, the sound of my own voice, and a very few minutes of thought, I realised that I needed to make something happen.
The pain had gone. But the pain always re-emerged, sometimes in small, intense bursts, sometimes in the form of a deep ache or a dull ache that felt like a thousand needles of ice stabbing at my eyes.
Harry tucked the photograph back into his breast pocket, looking the picture over.
make one he panted "you're not the boss of me!" you should put a note for him on the bed saying, "you're not the boss of me."
Its not just that, but they do have a long way to go.  Just like that one company in Canada was going to be creating a new game and would put a lot of money into it.  And then the game got cancelled.
Uncle Vernon opened his door.
Atta boy Dudley Heyer.  That guy was a true badass.
The Dumbledores lived in a house that they had built themselves. The family lived in peace and happiness, but their happiness was short lived. At the age of thirty-five, Dobby became possessed by a horcrux. The Horcrux was a powerful item,
Harry jumped off his bed and ran to the door
SEIZE HIM shrieked Voldemort, and there was a scream of protest from the wizard in front of me, but I just laughed as I pushed his shoulder into the wooden shelf, and pulled it away and it came crashing down on the floor and I grabbed it, and then I
Itit doesnt make very much sense in any form, even if the intention is good
But worst of all is how hard it is to find a job after graduating. No one seems to care about that, but it sure sucks to have to jump through so many hoops to get a job.
You each win Gryffindor  You each win a drink  *clink*
What did Dumbledore do to piss off that horcrux?  EDIT: I know the question is rhetorical, but I figured since I hadn't been able to guess what to ask in a thread today.
The child was laughing at him? That is incredibly funny and sad.
or else ed when he gets his way.
He had nearly lost both his legs in the war.
Harry opened it curiously. I looked in the box and there was a single card in it. It was a little card with a picture of a white dog on it and a card next to it with a number 6 inside. He handed the card over to me.
Puk ing Pastilles Nosebleed - Puk puk in nosebleeds.  I had a cold and they would not stop, they just went on and on.
He lay back on the bed.  He knew it was stupid, but he was too scared to tell anyone.  He didn't care about what anyone said, he didn't care about the risk.  His dick wanted to be inside her.  It wanted to
Hermione who had all the traits.

Neither Neville nor Hermione were particularly shy, they both enjoyed a good chat. They made friends in the first half hour of the meal as they passed round a bottle of wine, then after dinner spent an hour or so laughing at a joke they’d learnt. When
Make Harry get it. He's not very young, and the books have already gone through his growth and maturity in the past. He's not the sort of character who'll just sit on a shelf collecting dust after a lifetime of using them.  He should have gotten it
The gumchewing waitress shueded for a moment. He was supposed to be a doctor, and, in the world he thought he knew, women needed to eat. But his stomach was empty, and, by God, what did women do that they needed all that gum?
She peered at it.  "That would be the most interesting thing ever."
The weirdest thing about this is that she claims to live a very healthy lifestyle.

Harry wondered if Hagrid was really all there, or was he in it for a little money and fame.
Harry knew what Lupin would be when they met. They had known each other at Hogwarts for several years.
Good afternoon he said.
Ready Diddy asked Aunt Viv and Uncle Steph for a date on their anniversary
They reminded Harry of his great grandfather, the legendary wizarding god Ron Weasley.
All they really wanted was to sell out their country. The idea that the US would stand up against such a regime was a pipe dream that was never going to work.
So I arranged a little date for both my boyfriend and I tomorrow night.  We decided to go for the longest drive, through two major mountains, and explore as much as we could.  We were going to hike up, but ended up hiking out because of high

Remus Tonks cried as he heard of the death of the Death Eaters.  "This is really happening!" he cried out. "This is finally happening!"        Remus shook his head, disappointed that the prophecy was coming to its end
So he moved forward a week and lost one place (from a 5 to a 2.5) and was basically forced to drop a couple ranks? And people wonder why people say the LMS is a joke?
Nearly there Harry panted and his eyes watered as he looked around the room, he had been there so long he barely remembered.
I heard hes a bad actor
Hes going to Stonewall.
Voldemort had said nothing, as Harry was speaking, so Harry couldn't hear him. However, Harry knew where Voldemort was and knew he was close. If Voldemort wanted to kill Harry, he could. However, he knew Harry would not harm him, and would keep his
From downstairs came the sound of her mother's voice, "I had enough last week, honey!
Well sorry to let you down, but you gotta be more specific. I have a few I could give ya for free or with little to no cost if it was a more difficult case. Do you have a budget?  PS: I'm sorry if I missed something
And Dumbledore thought he would not need to write anything down anymore.
Now she watched in horror as an angry mob formed outside their door. When she was finally able to push her way through, she found her apartment ablaze and her friends inside, some trying to escape in the other direction.
I came camping here for the first time a week or so ago. The first night I had a little panic attack because I was the only one staying in the tent. I didn't think I was any less safe, but it definitely was unnerving.
The wizard leaned toward the door with a sigh, "This is going to sound strange, but I really need a drink." "You can drink on the job? I've been off the clock for awhile."
It placed him several feet above the ground, but still within the realm of possible death, and caused him to be unable to use his legs for balance, as well as to suffer from several serious mental health issues. I don't think that's so much "magic"

Dragon breeding was outlawed in the kingdom for being an "animalistic", "bloody", "destructive" and a "dangerous" method of hunting. However, it is now a popular form of farming thanks to its ease of use and low maintenance. With the
Was it his own fault? It seems like some people just can't help but say the dumbest things.   edit: not referring to the cop.

He also had a girlfriend, and was single for a long time. You don't just end up with an ex without doing something about it.
Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall.
Why didnt I make any money?
But Kreacher shook his hand, with his own and his friends' fingers still touching. The man looked back at the table, then back at him, the expression on his face slowly morphing.
Bill had a real impact.  No matter how terrible the people you're voting for it's the little actions, every little thing that contributes to the big change.  And that kind of change is a massive step up from what a year ago was.

The child began to cough so violently he passed gas while trying to breathe. He collapsed on the floor from the extreme reaction. The man, who was with his wife, took him to a hospital, where doctors began treating the toddler for severe respiratory distress.
The fact that Hermione is a witch and can't be a wizard is the most hilarious thing.
Just Ollivanders left now.

Harry nodded but stopped to look up.
He was at Hogwarts for only a few years
Chapter His missing tooth and one of the ones missing is the root of the problem, his teeth have to come back in order to function correctly.
All the studying he'll be doing and how much time he'll be spending doing it will make him less likely to get any work done. He'll probably be less likely to go out, either.

Umbridge laughed a soft cackle, she didn't get the joke. "You'll be glad when you get to Hogwarts, there's so many more things to learn from teachers here!" Umbridge's face was pale, like she wanted to die of embarrassment. As she
While Ron told Hagrid they should go ahead and finish the house and that they should go ahead and start working on the first tree and start collecting leaves from the hedges, Harry had made a wish on a crystal ball and it turned out to be true.

Harry lost the thread of conversation when he said he would have to look at the whole body.
Filch must have hurried them up.

Kreacher began to sob as he stared at the blood.
The whole point of the "DLC" is that the devs can charge more for it.  "I think it's a bad idea but you can still buy it so it's fine".  Not really.

His golden hair fell to his shoulders. The thin fabric of his pants ripped in several places. He glanced up at the ceiling as the sun started to come up and then stood, tossing his clothes from his body. His hair fell into his face, along with his hat

Stab shouted Harry his life as he lay in the hospital bed, his face bloodied. It took the doctor a moment to understand what had happened. Harry was the first to raise his hand. His dark brown eyes stared out of his hospital mask.
Luciuss wand is destroyed for the event and it seems unlikely to return.
He had his eyes on your ass the whole time
never bothered to say so, but i love how we're taking this sub seriously now.  i don't even know what the point is.
Even Harry who knew Harry was going to die, was surprised about it.
His pugnacious tone indicated to the world that the guy was going to be a winner. I've got a few guys like that in my office and they just keep on trucking along.
Hou are you going for? What are you trying to achieve with this? If you’re wanting to start a conversation and find out more about your friend, be casual. Let your friend know she has a good amount of supporters on her account and you’

So where next was?  You have to wonder if you ever get out of bed it's going to be the same thing.  I'm also guessing that he has something really important planned for tomorrow.
We havent won since the beginning of our series so I doubt we win tonight to be honest. We need an olympics miracle tonight.

You said it too - this can't be about "getting a feel for each other" or being with someone that you have "good chemistry". This is about a relationship that will end.
Ignoring his mingled oaths and curses, the man reached out and touched her hands in greeting. He had never seen a woman, never mind a high priestess, so warm and kind. He could hardly believe that his own sister, his twin sister, might be just a

Hagrid took up two books on magic in a house in America.
Im sorry to hear about your troubles man, but if i could offer any advice its to remember to make an account with only 1 email, then set it up to accept emails from only 1 device... this will help prevent them from getting the old gmail address you used

Itit was nothing he could not deal with
Professor Dumbledore left ten thousand years of experience and knowledge behind for the school and everyone's lives. The fact that this was put on a school shirt is a perfect representation of what he gave up in doing his job for the school. You can't just wear that shit at
Ron glanced toward the table where the girls were clustered.  He was used to the idea of girls going by the names of Sarah and Hannah and he had no problem with it, so long as it kept the girls separated from his brother.  "What's so funny
Ladies and gentlemen called it.

Be pretty interesting to see the change up the field with the new QBs.
They spun for a second before they fell back down.

It didnt seem very interesting. It's just a random video of some old guy playing something. But it did give me an idea of how to make the world more interesting, and a good idea.  Anyway thank you :)
Weird he said NMatlady, I assume he’s referring to the guy with a tattoo of the n at the bottom of his foot.
As evening drew in, the crowd got restless, eager for the food and drink.
Harry knew when they were kids that there was no real chance that he would have a family with her, that he couldn't really be anyone's father. Now it's finally happened, and he's terrified. This was one of my favorite scenes on Harry Potter.
Hagrid hed have found a way to use his magic, it would be a long story.

He gave a start on his book on August 17, 2016. I believe he has two or three more left to finish.
Disgusted that the Slytherins have voted for an alliance member so selfishly.
Well the sword Harry has in the books is the same sword Voldemort takes after killing his aunt and uncle. Voldemort knew Harry wouldn't believe Harry, he would try everything to convince Harry to believe him. That's why Harry's sword is named Harry. So I believe that

She tried to shield you from her own stupidity. I don't know your girlfriend and I would have been more impressed.  > I feel bad for this girl, but also the guys. This has all been going on for months and she never even seems to realize what

The brick he had in the pocket should of been out of bounds though. You can see it bounce off the ground before it hits the line. It was not a catch, it was in bounds.  Edit: my point, it was in bounds. My mistake.
Its traditional to give each of your guests a bouquet of flowers or at least a few colorful flowers. These can be a great gift for any man.

He could hear her from his desk in his small office in the U.S. Embassy in Ankara. "Thank you, thank you." he'd told her by email.

He set off drawing an arc with the knife, not with the screwdriver.

Well I saw the trailer for this and while it has a lot of potential, if they do too many gimmicky sequences, it won't have much of a chance at being a good action movie.
The rewhisky seemed to fit the bill very well. If that's the right expression for your palate, I highly recommend it.  There are several local distilleries that are doing a great job with their mash bills.  I've enjoyed the new Buffalo Trace Makers
The Patronus he was given, The Gryphon is a symbol of strength and courage to the Gryffindors, and in the original version it was the owl he was given.

Dudley stood with his right hand on his chin, his left hand resting on his left shoulder. His mouth was moving, as though he were speaking words of great length and force. He looked straight ahead. He wore a long white shirt, with the sleeves rolled up.
Of course Ron but he also says that he will never be a star athlete because he is white.
And if you remember that's one of the reasons the old game was such a big thing. It had the same mechanics but instead of having to constantly reload with a different weapon you'd be able to swap out and it would give you a small advantage over your opponent.
If its massive spiders and stuff, sure. If its just a tiny rat, fuck the rats. But i will still take this over rat sized bees.
Stop that said Ron Paul is a communist, and that the US government should have no business in any country's internal affairs.
So your parents knew he was a pedo but you thought that you were the innocent victim?
The last word came down before the season started. We need some more pieces. This off season and next are going to be rough. No one looks good, not even close. There has to be a shakeup.
Yes said Quirrell idly, "Aye, I did. They're at Hogwarts."
We were surrounded the entire time and never heard them.  I'm guessing that with the amount of space we were in, no one would've noticed it.

Then Umbridge raised her voice.
Dumbledore bowed his head. "We shall not let it go so easily."   He stood up and turned towards the door. "No, that it will not."
They vanished together into the distant horizon.
Dont you realize hes actually talking about how the game works, not what he wanted?
We thought Dumbledore had turned gay.  We thought Snape had turned gay.   We thought Harry was gay.     I knew it wasn't true.  I knew it was wrong, and I knew it was stupid.  But I was so young
One by one the men of the House of Lannister began to rise up. Ser Davos and Ser Barristan, their brothers and cousins, the two most experienced and most trusted of the Kingsguard. Ser Meryn Tully and Ser Gregor Clegan
Harry could tell from the moment she saw him that she was the one.   The problem is the way Hermione handled it.
Once you got over the idea of it being hard or anything, what you were really experiencing was a normal human reaction when playing a game on pc.
About ten minutes later, I was able to log into my account, and a message appeared in the sidebar that said the server had been restarted. This has happened every other time it's been updated, so I just ignored it.
No she said sharply. Her eyes narrowed to match her expression. "That is not a problem for me." She pointed her finger at the wall. "You have not even asked me to teach you how to play, and you are trying to force me into this? Come

When the bell sounded after the bell rang on Tuesday's trading of the S&P 500, some observers found it suspicious that it rang as soon as the market opened. That's because it had already settled around 10,000 points, with no major movements.
It was bright gold. Like, really bright gold. A million times more bright than any other light I had ever seen before, even when it was really far away. I couldn't see the whole thing clearly because it was so bright and the only other light around was

They were often joined by their sons, who joined the Communist party, like Chai (Somarika Devi). They also had a daughter, Bhandari, but this does not mention the names of her children.
Hesent that note I sent, we both seem to be in a bit of a daze! You think your ex would have noticed that I was upset over this if he hadnt done that? Ive been a bit off the rails myself since I was a bit hung

You arent serious Harry.....right?
Well are we all just going to sit here and let these men use our land illegally while we sit back and watch?  Edit: thanks for the downvotes, that's an interesting and valid question I didn't realize we were all going to just let the people break
Strung all around with a couple of strings. The two strung along the outside and on the inside I used to carry one each of a pink, yellow, and orange color.
Quirrell came back out for this scene, but I don't recall if the original script called for him to, if I recall correctly. If not, it was not a very good idea that he was forced into coming back.
Then none of them can make it into the HoF either, can they?
Please be careful Hagrid.
Stowing the Invisi bility.  It's always great to have the option, but it's just too good to pass up.
Perhaps it was simply you? If you are in the area today, you can always come by and chat with us at a coffee/cuppa at the coffee machine. We’ll even serve you, if you come by after 5pm and I think I

We know only the beginning of the story. But we can find out more from a recently leaked document.
She says Oh dear God I feel so stupid. The only thing that came to my mind was this, which I now see isn't really all that bad...
I have form only at the very beginning. I still have to figure out the finer points. The first couple of lessons were just getting through the basics. They were fun, but I had to put in a lot of hours to get good at it.
Malfoy said Neville shakily. "The man is nearly blind, Harry. You do realize that, don't you?"
She looked at him as she was getting ready to go to school. "I'm ready to go to school. I thought I had to come with you." She sat down, and sat at the other end of the table. She was still in her pajamas
The life he had, that he's now living without it is just a tragedy.
Dudley gently released himself and walked off with his hand in his pocket.
Well of course not, that would have been a terrible movie that didn't follow the books at all.
What I want more is the ability to switch between the characters, not just for the main characters like in the last game, but also for characters like Kratos, the Norse Gods, and the Warriors of Light. If you don't mind the change to control options
Hmm said a small voice to me is, maybe you can just use the word "noodle" it's not the right word to use. You never know if it's a girl or guy though and even then you have to be careful about any curse words or whatever
Ginny had been banned from coming to the dormitory when she went through security because she was dating Professor McGonagall (I think? She was too young to understand the concept of a relationship).  I think it was her second year

Theyll be here in the next few months, hopefully by the end of the year.
It had been the longest drive of his life and it was only the second time the young man had gone without sleep in two days. But the two-hour drive from Dallas to Oklahoma City meant everything to him.

And if the Ministry of Truth could be overthrown in the name of the state, what then? The only thing left would be a massive, unchecked authoritarian state.
They pulled on their hands and knees (or in the opposite way) while they were waiting.   One girl (very drunk) even yelled "I want to die" and kept repeating that.
Midnight on Saturday he will be getting ready for work and playing catch up on his studies for the day of the week of the week of the week.
Harry swallowed and looked up at her. "What do you want?"
Its got a few kinks to it. But overall I think it'll be a good way to show who will be leading the teams by the end of the season.
Harry Knocking over two cars on the right and one on the left, then he proceeds to slam on the breaks while the cop turns to see what the commotion is.    I'd have shot the first guy.  The second man was a fucking nutcase

Ive just seen Viktor the first time today. He's pretty good and has all the tools needed to be really strong. The problem is that his kit is pretty basic and pretty mediocre compared to everyone else out there.
So what on earths name is being used to mean "something of beauty"?  Also, where are my gay male-identifying-as-lesbian children? This is a problem, I tell you!
Midnight ticked nearer as a red glow of a flare appeared out of the darkness.

Its a fake raspedout and I don't know why. It really makes me sad as they did a pretty good job in the movie.
They had lingered a while. She did not know who was inside. She did not care. Her mind was elsewhere, at the moment that her body was being invaded by those who claimed the life of a mother in her bed. For a moment it was all she could

It made the whole thing so much less believable.

The zigzagging path lead to my death.
Getting to his feet, he gave a brief nod and said something to me in Farsi. I looked at him for a moment, thinking he had forgotten. Then, remembering that I still had the power, I stepped toward him.
Didnt you hear what happened to Dio?
Search me said Ron. Search for a small boy and you’ll find him, you old hag.
Harry took a look around the bar, noting some interesting faces and some people who would be likely to give him grief.
Voldemort said that he's been using invisibility potions in his own study. He could have just done that on the way out.
I woke up lastnight with a migraine and my friend brought me a glass of water, but still no relief. Is there any way to avoid getting headaches like this?
If hed been in a position where he could have pulled a weapon he probably would have. He is not. He doesnt have time to get another weapon, and if he couldnt find the knife he would have grabbed it or got closer. His actions were not a show

Ron reached inside his jacket pocket and pulled out a large piece of paper.  On it was printed:  "There is a way to find out everything about your husband.  First, ask yourself whether you still love him.  If the answer is 'yes,'

Harrys legs were like "damn, I'll take this shit"
Nearly always right she is. And she's not a man.
He took off the glove and showed the ball to his bat.  As soon as it stopped moving, it was clear.
Snape put them all in the dungeons at the same time in book 1, and they are kept there by Sirius. Harry isn't actually the first to go into a dungeons, and was the last one to leave. The first two we have were probably not in the dungeons

She fumbled in a high school play?  That's some grade A grade-A bullshit.  She is totally responsible, just like all the other high-schoolers who were on their cell phones with their hair in a ponytail that caused all this mayhem.
Hermione didnt turn up till at least the last chapter? So was there some point where they were just talking on the road and they didnt think to come back.   The ending where Ginny found out he died in the train accident was just stupid.
He could go anywhere he wanted to but I wouldn't be shocked if he picked us
Even now he could beat you up!
I don know why you would want to run into him, but I'm a little surprised you didn't catch the first mention of him when he was talking about his daughter in the first episode of the show.   He did come by in the end to give his
sir even if the dog ate your weed you still got stoned. It has nothing to do with the dog eating your weed. I can only think that weed ate your weed if you smoked and ate weed before the dog ate it.
Not only did they nerf the shield, the game seems like it is so much more of a cluster fuck now than it was before.
Sirius seemed to have a lot more personality in the earlier series. The actor he played in the earlier series was very much the main character, but in this series he's kind of the villain.
We didnt kill you tho.  Why you do this to us?
He might expect you to be the one to initiate something you haven't initiated yet. It's not a bad thing to ask, though. Most guys love to talk to girls they want to sleep with.
He was right next to the stairs and was trying to get to the top of the stairs faster, but his foot slips right out from under him and he falls down.
Listen the fact that everyone and their mother and father will be talking about the fight shows that it will be very close. I think Woodley will win but I can see Woodley going for the ko finish. I can see him getting a decision win with his jab.
Norberts at a tricky angle.
Stand back Wood warned. I'm already getting downvotes for it...
One fragile strand of a very large fabric is broken. This is like breaking your leg and walking off with a cast, even if you’re not seriously injured. But, it’s not good, and it may require medical intervention and surgery to reattach

Harry guess what said to his son is " I am your father" not "I am your daddy" and the kid replies "Well, it is neither of those, Dad."
Blood was pounding in my head, I could barely hear what I was saying, but I could feel that something had been shot at me.
Youd think we dragged our feet, if it was as simple as the media makes it out to be.  The fact that we've signed 2 players for 4 million each is something else. If we keep winning and building there is a hell of a lot more money to
Reveling in the removal of their rights. I am sure that all the feminists and "toxic masculinity" lovers are sooo pleased with themselves.

Filch knew the secret of making people smile in Hogwarts. He knew it from Snape who whispered it in his ear.
He glided toward them, a cool black metal sword at the ready, and I couldn't help but think "Fuck, what if he tries to kill them?"

Sniff around my sweetheart’s house and pick up all the things that she’s written in her hand-written journals. Or just go through her old clothes and find a sweater that was never worn. Or, get a feel for her favorite music.

He was waiting for you to look away, not so he could get you to look but so he could sneak up behind you and stab you to death.
Whats the matterIn a hurry to get home and get it out
Hermione was checking Harry's pocket for something, and his arm was wrapped around her waist.
Luna had decorated her bed with some pretty flowers.
And women Wood agreed. It has to be something to do with a woman.
Hermione had taken his wand and her other wand before she even got to the school.
A few moments later they were sitting on the top step of a stone landing near a door, looking out across the forest. Their eyes fell on the other party members, who were being brought into the room.
For the rst time you see a man wearing one of the best outfits around
Hermione was stomping up a mountain.  You guys think Ron was stomping up a mountain?  LOL, he was just making Harry jealous.
Panic pulsed in the city as the news of a deadly terror attack in the capital of Baghdad, the capital of Iraq, broke out last Thursday. People stood outside their homes in the capital to find out if their neighbors were safe. The government quickly announced a curfew in the
said Hermione slowly and with a sigh
Harry crammed the broken wand into the small, red box Harry had acquired from the orphanage and stuffed it into the leather pouch he’d received with his wand. His wand hung on his belt, looking as though it had been lost in the woods.
Harry felt afterward that he was not the only one who would take his advice, he decided that he would put his ideas to the test, so that the young lord should be guided by others, even if they were of his own sex.
Chapter The Deathly Hallows Part 2 has been nominated for both the Hugo and Nebula awards. The Hugo award is given out in April and the Nebula award is given in August. It seems the writers wanted to end it on a bittersweet note, so I was surprised to see
Wheres my letter said? I've already sent it to my lawyer lol
Explain then said Harry. What in the hell does it want from him?
Curious indeed how these changes were applied. Was there a general shift to an "un-stacking" way of farming gear? I have no doubt that those with geared characters would go right back to farming the same content again, but I think that that isn't necessarily
The name of Grindelwald? Harry Potter.
Dudley go just go. You will miss out on so much great stuff and will spend your entire time playing a dead game. Not to mention you can go to a lot of worlds.
Griphook Griphook was yet to make an appearance in the show. It was implied in the final battle that he was alive in some way, since he was seen walking on the battlefield.
Neville you dont know what the truth is
Nothing was explained nothing was touched. I didn’t even see any of the actual scenes.
He wrenched the telescope from her hands and threw it against the wall.
Were going up to beyound the Rockies in the mountains next weekend and the mountains are closed on the weekends. This looks like fun. Is it hard to get?
Harry moved toward the other students. He couldn't help but smile as he saw the ones he knew from their own school, and then he felt as if he was in a movie. He recognized a few others, including his old friend from their seventh grade class, Sam
The silence was shattered.
Lunas got ten times this...
I suppose she thinks all of the other houses are a scam...
Harry kept looking nervously at the sky after he came across the red cross and the words of warning in the air; he had no idea what else there would be. Then he finally caught a glimpse of a pair of large red goggles that appeared on the top of a pair
He swung his legs so hard he broke his own legs.  How's that fair?
Ron and his brothers are not in the family anymore, they still get some special attention.   However, their behavior is getting ridiculous.   I'm glad your family is getting better!
Indeed Phineas Nigellus inadvertently set fire to the ship he was operating, causing the ship to burst into flames as it attempted to land, as is to be expected. The ship also broke into many pieces and exploded like a nuclear bomb in the process.
One year old and I don't even know if I can remember what the original is. My husband and I are thinking of getting a tattoo at least but that's about all
Ten pairs of startled-looking and out-of-place-looking black-and-white cats, staring in bewilderment at one another for a while, before settling down to business.
Well theyre not completely out of the woods on that one. Thats like saying, well lets not put a stop to pollution and pollution hasnt stopped because we put a stop to putting the stop there.
Oh dont start that shit again, you know the answer is no.  And to those who were downvoting me earlier, I hope this was a good comeback.
My wand acted of its own accord when I used it.  The wand would change color as it was used and the wand that was first used showed me the color that my wand showed.   I can tell you that it wasn't the exact same colors of the
He wanted to see me, he was confused, he wanted to be with me. This lasted three days.
He crossed the corridor, and the first image the young warrior saw was that of his mother. She sat in her favorite recliner, one arm resting on its armrest and the other held by her other hand. Her hair was gray and her eyes were gray.
Funny the way peoples opinions on this change change.  I dont think this is good, at all.
Blocks of ice cream. It is a strange sensation to feel all your body warm then get cold all over again.
This is it. The moment.
Anger was coming to me all day. I've been sick to my stomach over the last week and I wanted to scream at the world for being so cruel. But then, I had to remember that I'm no better than anyone else. I just hope that someday,
Didnt I tell you to stop making new accounts?
Harry looked in the mirror, looked at his eyes, and sighed with a tired sigh that reminded Harry of the time when his mother had had his eyes done. He looked back at his reflection. “They’ll fix my eyes.”
Expelliarmus Mundunguss wand soared,
Can we help you get laid
Another Weasley You breed you filthy rat!
Professor Black said Hermione didn't want her to marry Bill because she wanted a son and a good husband to teach about family, etc. I wouldn't take that quote out of context. But I'd also take the quote about Ron because he was also very concerned about the
There isnt a reserve but I got mine by paying full price for shipping to my address in So Cal.   So I would call to see if they got any in stock and ask for the order number.
The big one said "you got that right".
Up atthe High Table by the Black Tower and see if it still works there.
Perhaps because it was in your case - you went for some things that people in general do not seem to enjoy, but are actually quite enjoyable?
He wished that he was with you. I was with my ex the entire time, even when he was out of town,  he wanted to see me, and we talked every night. He even said he was looking forward to "meeting me"  He was

The very same summer that Michael Brown was killed and all of our country's "woke" people were ranting and raving about racism, Michael Scott, a Black man, shot his white coworker.
Villagers were crisscrossing in the rain to collect water from the pond and take a dip on the lawns. The air smelled like freshly brewed coffee, the trees and leaves were swaying back and forth, and the sun looked like a silver ball at times.
Do you said the same thing with Tenga eggs?
We saw it said the same thing in the last patch notes:  >"We will be adding a new "Battleground" and the "New Dungeon" that was introduced in 5.0.3"  I think that's pretty much what this post is
Which is your wand?
They climbed more staircases than I did when I climbed Everest.
Morning said Hagrid to the Weasley twins before heading for his desk
Stand back said Griphook in his final video, "it's a bit like the story of the guy that gets lost in a cornfield..." and the man behind the camera did not know who he was.
Professor McGonagall blew her brains out.
Ron looked toward him and said, “Oh, that’s what you’re here for?”
Why should he be afraid? It's not like the government is trying to kill him. He's just a citizen who was arrested and charged with committing a crime.
This is a wizards exclusive card right? How the hell did we get it
Theyre all right shaken.
Looking rather pleased with herself in those images, that's one of those 'you know you're going to be hot' moments.
He went straight to the frontpage
As Harrys ngers closed I remember when it used to have two separate floors.  It was a shame that the old school arcade got swallowed up by the massive basement level.
of Wizards Dear Mr. Nix
And from what they're saying it is a great game, just wish it had more options for movement. And no, I don't care if it's a "walking simulator", it just doesn't feel like one.
Doge banged him on the last play of the game
Harry recognized him at the Dursley wedding? I always thought it was just Dumbledore recognizing the scar.
That couldve happened as well
Thats what hes after.  Im a female and I think its really pathetic how many of us have had to deal with creeps, whether on the internet or in real life, who insist on trying to get attention from us, whether we want it or not.  I just
Having a last meal. Or the last thing you will eat.
At once object after another!
Its supposed to leave its own mark, by the way... I think you are the first person to comment on this issue, so I have no idea if that is the reason but just letting you know its not a "bug."
Itll be dangerous but itll be ok, I'll be sure to follow your progress.             *(I'll be waiting for your post about how you fell over backwards off a cliff.)*
A second very small ship could have saved her.
Leaves you free to do other things.
The snake struck as it tried to eat the fish, but the shark took the opportunity to eat the snake first.
It was staring down.
All along I thought that the joke was that someone would have to eat the other person's brains in order to avoid the same fate as the other person...
We could send Norbert back to the past!
Ive just thought of something  The only reason they did all of this in a span of 5 minutes in the first place was because the guy with the red light outside the gas station saw all this happening. He took a picture. After everyone got out of their cars,
Kreacher dropped his sts? Where did he stash them?
He came across the street, and took his guitar into the house of the lady he had seen in the garden of the inn that day. She was a woman so beautiful that a mortal man like himself could hardly have given her up.
Im sure Firenze thought the same thing, the guy would have loved being a Ferrari employee or a McLaren driver.
Anyway wed better go over the fact that we will be playing 2.5hr games with no breaks?
Chapter If that is the case, you are supposed to kill him in his lair, he is there. Otherwise, it just becomes a huge open space with lots of enemies.
In fact when all else fails use a condom.
Have a Chocolate Frog on one side, have a Sushi on the other.  You know what to do
She had bought him a new hat.
As for Harry and Ginny, the fact that they can see each other without their eyes doesn't sound all that great. They might get along better now that Ginny seems to have become more open minded though.
Honestly Hermione you think there is a chance you might be pregnant?
No wait a moment.  Does it have a removable battery?
Hislessons too were becoming more and more popular! I loved seeing him on here and it was nice to know he got at least one reader. This is a good story. You can tell a lot about his character in the way he uses pronouns, etc.
This Snitchhe held up the car.
Voldemort had powers I didnt even see coming
Dont make us hurt anymore
Perhaps brooms like horses are on the same level of technology, and this is what they are referring to.
Ahead Harry could see signs of Meghan at her wedding with new dress
I cant see Voldemort winning against Dumbledore, in the sense that he's been to prison before.  In the sense that Voldemort is a much stronger character than Dumbledore, I could easily see Voldemort outwit Dumbledore on several occasions.
Not spposed ter use as deoxys?
Im dyeing some of my hair red and it turns out looking like my older brothers hair.
Weve never been spotted.
Could we use the new'reddit is fun' reddit app?

Listen come an see you later
Heheard hooves behind him, a horse's head. "Halt," he growled, and stopped. "Who's there? I know you're there."
How could they ever know who you are? Did you send them the info? If so, how?
She had to look away when she heard her dad talking, because it made her sick to her stomach.
Im not sure thats actually true, i have been playing since release.  Only once have ive been matched with a teammate and they have been afk since the beginning. The rest were leavers and the rest just ignored my calls or killed me
Lupin was wearing an offical suit.
Harry couldnt think of a proper name so he went with Ollivander.
Exactly what he was trying to do with the second one.
Harry didnt trust himself with the ministry.
Harrys heart seemed to be beating a lot quicker in that scene.
And now you mention it, you are completely right. I just realized I never thought about how the new UI made it harder to see some of those cards in the deck.
I think youre right, it probably isnt his fault, but it isnt an act that really makes him look all that great either.
Ron was making no attempt to hide his frustration. "Damn it, get your butt over here and fix that mess! You stupid idiot!"
First years should note this as part of the course. I can't stress this enough.
Ron looked at his son. He held him tight to him as they were being attacked.
Then she walked up to her and told me she had the biggest tits I have ever seen in my life
Chapter Hes fainted said, 'It is the Lord of life and the death, both of them; that hath he not? The Lord of life and the death, both of them? The Lord hath he not? The Lord hath he not.
Theywere bound to notice.
He stepped in front of him? You were about to beat his ass if you hadn't hit him.
Good youll do perfectly well. I dont see why so many people here are so against vaping just cause they don't like it.
The Dursleys often spoke to their cats. When Harry, who had been a cat before he became a son of the King, was about to die of a horrible disease, they visited their cat Hermione in her room, telling her that they loved her and telling her to stay
Avada Kedavra The green light?
They are the bestalthough you may want to try getting a 4G sim card since they are really slow and unreliable
And slowly Harry looked around for a nice dark alley...
But whats he after his 3rd time?
Whos Gregorovitch I dunno if I should go on /r/hockey and hope this ends the game or call him a cunt
Harry remembered Ron telling Hermione that they were going to have more kids after the Battle of Hogwarts, which seems to imply that a second child might have happened, but didn't.
Harry walked to the bridge to start watching the sea.
Course some stood up and others didnt.
they cant be here.
The Ministrys being very inconsistent with their information.
What really happenedIt was early October 2005, during the first week in October, when my daughter was in nursery school. Her teacher took me aside and said she'd had a horrible nightmare - a real one, like many of her peers, she told me. The class had
Course he shoulda sacked her. I'd take that job.
He saw his reflection in the reflection of the camera...
The golden grilles clanged against the bars of the iron cage.
Chapter But Bill saw the little girl's face.
It shows us nothing.
Suddenly Harry felt wideawake. 'Damn it!' he said, and jumped up, going into the kitchen.
Thinking that it could have worked out the other way and I would have found another job and she wouldn't have been in this horrible situation.
Mind you I brought the girl for a picnic in the park and all she did was throw the salad at me.
But you dont use your full combo in the 4th
Harry let her talk to Snape?  *I'm confused*
Like this he said: "We have the same amount of votes. I have the same amount of money, and this money buys votes. In the same sense, my vote buys votes. A vote for a Democrat or Republican does not. You can be a billionaire or
Though much smaller and less influential than the United Nations and the European Union, Japan is still seen as a leading player in global financial regulation. Japan's role as a finance heavyweight in the world is more prominent than that of its Asian peers, but it is far from being
much kinder than trying to use an actual real person to scare him.
They havent got a clue what to do with him. We havent been close to a contender in years
This boy was another example of how we all have the potential to improve or change and yet the system fails us.
The tub was full so i had to take a bath to clean up, that was fun.
He slipped out of the back door and ran.
Reaching the spiral stair. There is this place that only has 4 steps, but they will not fit the stairs on the stairs down. The steps themselves are only 3 steps tall and the stair down is longer than the stairs up, so it makes it impossible to go down
On the corner he’d place an order, his mouth water, then drive off with it tucked behind his ear so no one could see the contents.
There were moments when he was an absolute baller. Even with this regression, he has been the best defenseman on our squad. When we have to have a game of "Hockey 101" we just need a puck like that to get the win.   Still
Hagrid had emptied vault in search of magic
If it has to be more than one character, then its an unfair advantage because one person is using their controller while the other doesn't.
Just like that she is done as a host? That sucks. I liked her.
Slowly the edge of the wall has been torn down, and the walls of the city are crumbling.
And why do you have to put "no" in the title. It's already implied you have something against it.

A bright silver light shone above her head and a cloud of smoke enveloped her, she started to scream but the cloud quickly dissipated and the light faded and she was left alone.
Marges ill he informed the police, they were only going to make his problem worse as they have said his previous convictions were "involuntary manslaughter"
And I reckon hes gonna make a run for the presidency in 2020.   Oh well, what can ya do.
He Ron and Hermione had a little girl.  Ron is trying to figure out if he should adopt the kid because it's "his kid" and not because he's a huge fucking asshole and he's too much of a coward to deal with the fact that his kid
Imagine losing ngernails Harry 😢
Before we go any further, I need to remind you that I have not had a single person from my high school call me "Sweetie" in years. So you may want to get used to this new title, since I probably won't get back to you if
Since Dumbledore died were the Ministry's plans for the wizarding world?
At the time of the invasion, the Ottoman Empire held about 5 million Christians and 20 million Armenians. Since then, some Christians have converted to Islam, and the Ottoman Empire has become the majority Muslim state in the area.
Chapter Next a pool of heroes, the same team as this game. I don’t understand why so many players are against this and even want it to fail.
Slowly they had built up confidence in the new guy at centre back, which is strange because we have really good centre backs in our team.   Then he scored 2, then another.   I think he could be that world class player to become captain of us
I do not know if this is the place to post but I was having trouble with the mod that came with the game. I got to the end of the chapter and it did not activate. Then I removed the mod from my Steam and it activated fine. Does anyone

Harry heard his heavy breathing, and jumped up, feeling his body shake in his sleep.
On Saturday things began to go wrong, in no small part because, as the day wore on, the weather remained cool, the air remained dry, and the road conditions remained uneven and bumpy. At about 10.30 p.m. I, along with several
Harry didnt miss a trick he left his phone in the car with the keys in it.
Cups shields plates and glass, not sure about the glass plates, it just has to be in a car that isnt in the road... And yes you can get the shields for it in the dlc, but it's super rare, so it's kinda pointless to
Hed tell us to stop drinking.
Peeves was bobbing halfway to the ceiling.
So what kept you from going out to other women?  Not being mean - genuinely curious here.
Ron passed Harry the other day and we were all sitting around Harry's telling stories and reminiscing and reminiscing and reminiscing and reminiscing about old times and old times and old times and old times
Harry did not know what to say as he was about to be introduced to Ginny.
She had no wand.
Harry drew closer gazing at the girl. “Are you all right?”  “Yeah but,” she pulled her head back looking for him “you’re still here. Where are we?”  “A hotel in

Ron sat up straight and straightened his tie, and looked out the door for the first time since he woke up in the middle of the night. "What the hell is wrong with you?" He yelled to no one.
Listen Harry would yeh? You should see that woman on the telly. I'll bet she's the most famous celeb in the world.   The point is, the British are not a proud people and if they feel like it, they will come and tell you
The temperature in the area is currently 34 degrees.
CHAPTER SIXTEEN THROUGH THE VIEWINGS OF THE OLD MANS
Harry paused pondering his next line of questioning. "So do you guys all actually know each other, or do I just have it wrong? Because I sure as hell haven't seen or talked to most of these people in three years. And the only one I know that

The boy lifted the heavy metal door open and stood there, arms raised, panting. He smiled, the boy smiled back. "Well?" he said. "You're very good at this. I believe I may have just stumbled across a great invention." He paused
Itll look just like the real thing!
Nice wand for charm.
And its helped us achieve so much, so thanks Microsoft and Sony for killing PC gaming.

Snape finished calling the wizard's staff.
Standing beside its burnished red car in a black-carpeted carpark in the middle of downtown Seoul, Lee Sang-yoon looked to the side of him. In the darkness he could see the streetlamps on Jogye-dong and he
And then I meant to take that one picture for you, but it got all mixed up with all the other things.
She and Ted exchanged some looks on the set with the photographer (?)...
Harry could visualize them. But Hermione's was pretty cool because she could conjure up an image of herself in her own mind, without ever leaving her house.
The rst read THE OLD MAN’S TRAP for the first time and I thought, “Wow this is pretty good” then remembered it was for the audiobook version so maybe it’s not as good as I thought it was.

Youll learn fast enough. As for the pvp, dont bother
Twenty minutes later they were down 3-0
It was close to the end of Season 4, and at the end of that episode one of the cast members of The Office said that Jim and Pam are the best match for each other, so you can infer that they had a relationship.
He remembered being picked up.
Harry stued his rucksack and was about to get into his car when he heard a voice behind him. "Hey, Harry, whatcha doin'?"
Found the perfect place to relax!
I had every right to be as pissed off as I was. You don't know what it took, he was probably in a tough place, I don't even care if he "felt bad" I could see that not every day will be the best time to tell
He wasnt in Great Britain though was he? I thought that was in the Netherlands
The young witch in this story is only like a decade younger than you and she's clearly not mature enough to hold her own with you.   If you're so emotionally invested in her, you could try talking to her parents about it, see if they would reconsider
Harry followed Fred and George to the library as George gave him a kiss on the cheek, Harry then watched as Fred began to walk off. He then said that Fred was a brave kid.
They edged along the back roads, passing a couple of homes and out of sight of the road signs, avoiding the more obvious highway patrol vehicles that had the words “Crimestoppers” written across them.
They moved silently wherever they felt they were most needed - right in front of us.
And in the instant he left, he broke off a very important conversation with "What do you think of 'I Can't Take It'?"
He looked as if he was having a blast!
You had better get a job.
Repeating it tonight in the "noobs only" thread.     I am in love with this game for various reasons. I will never play a game quite like this again, not even on a console. I have no doubt in my mind that it will
This seemed to cheerRon a little up when he got out of his car.
Now wait here Hermione, for if you do not give them up now, they will come for you in a year.
Bouncing toward Mrs. Weasley.  I'm sure she's been to the beach before.
Harrys mind wandered a bit
Dyou think I havent tried it yet? How do you think I did then? I didnt like the way I looked so I dont want to be the ugly fat guy
She stood watching him, trying to see how he was trying to communicate with his new-found companions, who she would have expected would be much quieter than they were.  She could hear them breathing and she felt her skin prickled, but she didn't dare to

Harry didnt look it for 10 years, so not saying you have to wait that long!
The whole of Hogwarts. It's a great school full of friends and love. If it weren't for how good the school is and the fact that Dumbledore would be there, I'd hate it.
Hes a funny man. Youd think it be so simple to have some of his jokes as the intro. Like when hes making some sort of joke. But noooo that would just be a waste
Crouching down beneath the dark green leaves of an apple tree, a group of children giggled, oblivious to the ominous sounds in the distance. At first it seemed as if a group of teenagers were at the end of the road playing a game of tag. Then, suddenly
Anyway Harry said the truth, I'm going to continue to use my middle name as a name.
Chapter Bathildas Secret Harry Potter Secrets
There was next to no reaction to that incident and now some people are claiming that he killed himself.

Finally we regret to inform you that our beloved dog, Mr. Xzibit, has succumbed to cancer after a lengthy battle with the disease. Our family, in fact, is deeply saddened that Xzibit could not hold out the rest of his years to
She stirred then sat up.  I took a peek under her gown.  There was nothing that I wanted to touch.  "Good night."  I said as quietly as I could.
With a leap of a hand, I grabbed a small box.
From inside the crate you get a notification on your phone. Also if you are in the room where the crate is placed it is in the corner.
Chapter Xenophilius strode back into the room with the bloodied and dismembered body of an older man in tow. He stood next to an unstrung wooden chair, his hand still clutching the remains of a broken pipe while the other two held his shoulders. There was
The din was deafening. It was almost as if a giant black, furry ball with a snout had just landed on the back deck, blocking off the entire room. The screams and wails coming from above were deafening, and only got louder from the first person.
Shut up now Hermione.
You know I think it's the other way around   I think everyone is so much more concerned with the world ending than they should be
A game of Quidditch.
You all right Hermione?
The Potters knew very well how to hold court.  I am not sure if they were in the same league as the Habs or Bruins, but they certainly were top shelf.
A disembodied female voice said, "I think you may be onto something with this little project we've begun."
Ron struggled for a moment, unsure whether to take the plunge. Finally he agreed.
It was stifling hot as fuck out. We had to go down to the ground level because it would have been a waste to run the show on top of the roof.
The accusations he had multiple sexual relationships with underage girls (which he was convicted of in 2004, while he was a student at Pepperdine, which I have mentioned on here before) and he bragged about it.
All right thirty seven.
Read it he told me he would get his son into the military.
But what arethe Deathly Hallows titles? I mean, one is obviously the first book in the series but does the second book deal with different timeframes, or is it only one specific time frame?
I got this out of the game's website. I'll pm you.   Also, it just came out and has only been out for a few hours. No need to be a dick.
Hed screamed whacked his dick off, he fell off the stage and they made him cum in the backseat
Do it again Dudley, your mom says it hurts when we jerk off.
What should we do now?
People jostled him on the way out. One guy even put his head in his lap and gave him a high five. He wasn't going anywhere, after all.
Frustration and bitter disappointment have been constant themes for the Dallas Stars for the past few years. With three losses in a row, it's easy to lose hope about this season and the future.
to put up the most important point possible. this is no "hacking". there is no proof that the files actually existed, they only exist because they were leaked.
Each of them was able to see and hear me while I was still in the same house.
Shes right said Ron Paul should be a presidential candidate and that he might win the presidency.  It would make our country more prosperous and secure, while bringing a different kind of governance to America.
Well hehe doesnt want to be seen as creepy but if he doesnt want to see you naked, dont show him your naked body. I know that I wouldnt want to show some random person my genitals if it was a situation that I did not want to. It doesnt
When I get married, we'll be able to spend most of our day in our bed watching football.  That'll be nice.
Over the noise Snape is doing I heard his voice, I think it is Snape himself.
But Harry only had 4 books to read

Remus Remus come back to us, boy!
Harry went back to the dorms. He had been looking at them for the past three days. Finally it was time to settle in.
He glanced over at me. I didn't expect him to be this close.

Youve met Malfoy before, right?
Lots of people had a big issue with the final scene of the first movie. I'd like to see someone take a close up view and show how that's what the director intended.

Due to the danger to our soldiers on the front line, and the loss of lives, the decision was made to send a second company, with one of the best guns in the field, to this area.
It was agony to see the new album art and no sign of this at all. I guess it can be expected if they're focused on touring and festivals, but I would've liked to see their vision for this record for this very reason.
Blimey thats scary said I. It makes me sick as fuck though..  I have a few things in my collection which I fear might turn up.. If I ever met the guy that sold it and realised it was missing its mine, if its a bit of a dod

Modeled ttingly enough upon the real-life Piers Corbyn, the "The Queen Is A Dummy" billboard on New Haven's Main and East streets is the work of a local advertising agency.
He spread his arms and legs wide, and his hands spread far apart. He bent his knees and leaned forward, keeping his back straight and his hands in the air.
He barely made it through with his life as it is, without a chance of the government or the police even caring about him.  I don't think he should have to.  At least now he'll get a little more than "they didn't think he was
Professor Snape has more class than I do.
The Dursleys ducked but Harry went in anyway. He had no choice. It's not like he needed to explain to his parents how he met a woman. I'm just saying, if they wouldn't have put their daughter in a situation to get hurt it would've been
Thats what we should have done with him, he isn't worth what he's getting and we gave him a lot to do and he did it.
Dont take it personally but it is very hard for people from other countries to understand this concept, it is much more difficult than what you think. It is a very complicated concept. I suggest you to do some research before asking, the topic is quite complicated.

Aunt Petunia found a way to solve her relationship with her nephew: She took off his glasses.
Sometimes there were several people there, but there were not a lot of times when it was only me.  I would always ask the barkeep to keep the beer cold, so that I could drink it in a glass without touching the ice cube.

No idea said Harry. The moment he did the "Might be able to find someone else" statement in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, he became a master at finding another person. He was also a master of all things that didn't involve him.

She eyed him with the most seductive stare he'd ever seen. When she'd stopped looking up, he'd realized she was staring at him. She hadn't moved, so it looked as though he'd missed seeing her.
While Uncle Vernon made sure everything was in order, my Aunt and Uncle got going early.

Snape could send Phineas as his right-hand man for his entire life, and he'd still be a bigger dick than the entire Malfoys and Death Eaters combined.
She was already wearing a crown at one point during the game, though the crown she wore before didn't fit her.
Harry peered out of the window, watching the sun begin to fade as the clouds began to darken over the horizon.
He had passed out before the game and woke up right before the game. I don't know how much of it is his fault, but a lot of it is, because he can't stop the fact that he can't help himself from smoking.
But somebody betrayed us.
A brutal triple murder in South Los Angeles
Its a bit odd. Maybe that was supposed to be a reference to your dad's character?
There was the nest of the first-timers in the middle of a grassy field in the center of town. If a guy with a camera could get it, so could a guy with a video camera.

It is ze only good idea I heard today.
Wands are only as good as their wielder. If you can't wield them, your damage will be lower. You can't enchant or buff them but that's why you need the rest of the party to be doing damage themselves to give you the support you need.

For the reasons you've listed, and a few more (I think), I'd say "Yes."  And I'm also fairly sure the only other way to build the house you want it in is to take out all the other properties you don't want and build
Krum did not seem like a person who enjoyed being the center of attention. He wasn't a fan of anyone's attention, so I wouldn't be surprised if he was annoyed by this.
This was something you were born with so just get used to it, it's how they were made.
The only potentially useful thing I can think of is an electric eel, but even so, you still have to feed it.  An electric eel can't just live in an aquarium, and it's not going to make your life a living hell trying to feed

Nameless forebodings crept upon me.
Theres the silver lining for this. There is a big chance we can see some new gameplay and possibly some more details about DLC2. But I have a feeling DLC2 might be announced at the E3 2018 Direct which is like, this week.
I can nish the whole thing. I'm thinking maybe a full out remake or rework? Maybe a whole new level?
Harry cleared his throat. "We found you in time, dear." Harry had taken her arm into his, and she held tight to his forearm while he held himself together. This was his one mistake of the day so far, and he wanted to make sure they caught their

Never said Hagrid irritably told off his father, I’m pretty sure if your parents were abusive and mean to you your first instinct is to leave the family.
When I openmy eyes and see the sky I just don't know what to think.
You knowthat night you saw him coming, it came early. At first he was slow, but his eyes began to glow.  They had a light, and he was glowing in them. He would smile and turn towards you, and he would say, "Hey"

Harry sped forward propelled forward, feeling the air rush out through his nostrils.
He looked around the room, unsure what to do.
He usually gets me at a point in my day where I feel like I have no energy. He will start and I'll be so doped up I'll barely be able to watch or play.  So then he'll give me the game of the month/year

Harry Potter rolled over on the sofa and tried to sleep. He rolled over again just as the door bell rang. Harry looked up, and saw that it was not his mother. He jumped to his feet and ran out of the house.
He felt beleaguered and in pain as he tried to fight his way around the building. He was so angry. He knew this was wrong. He was supposed to be here as the team's spokesman for the championship. He was supposed to be at the event to take part

Don mention it said to bring the key ring, I did and it worked. Then the next week I needed another one and asked about it because I didn't remember if they had one at the store I got the key ring at. Nope, and I had to buy
Harry was reminded of the time he nearly got his parents killed. His mother came to his father's defense at the very last minute.
There it was again, "They'll be too distracted trying to fix all their issues with the season to watch football"   They didn't need to watch football with the problems they have going on, the lack of discipline, the poor play, the injuries,
Not unless youd rather have them there.
No Hermione I know he is a good guy and all but he really isn't Hermione's type and the fact that he lied about something so important to her and said that it was normal for her to use a condom made him seem really bad.
It happened very suddenly. I was in a room of about 60 people, and there were only 3 or 4 people I did not know. We were all having lunch together, and he said that he would like to make some kind of announcement to the rest of the group.
They walked on through a world so strange and wild,
His eyes fell on the small black dog which was sleeping close to his feet on the floor of the lounge area, and the sight drew his attention.
How the ruddy hell did he play all of the game?
The countryside now flying above the country
You think it wise to put a gun to your own head?
How long he stood in there for, i would like to know.
The moon was bright and shining that night, and the clouds drifted slowly away, leaving behind a dazzling orange and blue landscape.
He had written only one thing since his election in 2004 – a letter for a Christian group in the US, the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, asking for help in combating bullying. He continued with such letters for a further seven years. His main area of interest was the
ddont know why you’re getting downvoted, this is the truth. no shame in losing in my eyes
Come on then.Harry followed them down the alley, trying to hold back his sobs. It was nearly impossible. Every time Harry came to rest on his stomach, he was reminded of Ron's face and how he's so much better than him at keeping a secret. Harry
You called the locket? You bastard.
He paid seven gold coins for his wife's wedding ring? I wonder what she looks like without it.
Youre on the list!
Dudley sat down heavily in a chair with his head bowed, his hands in his lap. "There must be something I can do."
Ive just been instructing kids to say no to any requests they dont have money for. This stops them from asking for money a lot more often.
To Ronald Bilius Weasley. I think I was around 6. I didn't understand Harry Potter at all but that was the first book I read. I was terrified of Hagrid, loved Harry, and was sad that all the good stuff had to go.   I
Ronhad already had a good day, then came along. Good for him.
Each house has its own rules, no, I don’t think so. And yes, when it comes down to it, there’s no way of doing a “simulated” playthrough without cheating. You could get an answer to the whole
Whether hed manage to complete the tour, or not, it'd be worth the trip imo. Not only is that an amazing course, but the crowds would be insane.
The cold was agony. It made me think that we don’t really understand pain and suffering, that we do understand the short term effects, the short term impact, but that long term, the impact is so severe and so long lasting, that we just don
During those few moments of euphoria and excitement, they’ll do an awful lot of laughing.
I can help some tomorrow. What's your GT and what should I have on my toon?
hang you by your cock and call you a bitch
But Shut up Ron Paul would be the same in the first place. He's just getting started.
Bathilda also parrots the concept of a "superman", calling Batman "my dear friend"
Neville had been sobbing quietly as his wife left. “I didn’t want it to happen,” he said to the police. “We’d been having our troubles, but things were getting better – and better.”
Then he shouted Theres more!
Hes foundout everything he could have known by now.
And there in the background is the only reason I'm left in this world.
The sky had turned a deep grey at the peak of a steep hill. We could see for miles below the top. I wondered if we would meet the same fate down that way.
Filch Snape and Mrs. Weasley. I love their relationship and the way it comes into the canon. There's just so much depth to their characters and it's obvious how they would be together.
The grilles shut with it, and it was locked
Its Hedwig said Harry’s name was Hedwig, so technically Harry was Hedwig.
As they had passed the time for getting the letter from Hilda, Daphne went up to Mrs. Elgin and asked her to take her mother to the town hall to show it to the town board.
Uncle Vernon chuckled.   “He was born just in time,” he laughed.   “There’s always a chance to save an innocent life.”
This belonged to Regulus before he joined the Black Order.
The imprint of the words of the Old Testament (the Torah) were often used in the artworks of the biblical era such as that of Joshua or of Moses. In fact it was this art which was considered by the scholars to have the largest number of texts.
The sky was now blue, and everything around him was pink.  He'd never seen anything like it.  It was the happiest thing he'd ever seen.  The world was one big pink cloud.
.Dad said Dudley suddenly. *crickets*
As Grindelwald never extended an invitation to Harry or Ron to come into his office at Hogwarts (where he kept Muggle books), I am more than certain this never happened.
The Weasleys were clearly evil, but I just didn't see Voldemort doing anything *that* bad. Voldemort didn't even have a choice!
Hermiones hand was suddenly bigger for a split second. "I see..."
If she was really a virgin then don't lie about being a virgin to her face? This is her first time, and you're doing her a disservice not to tell her the truth...
So great was his leadership that he was the one that took up all the extra space on the line that O-Lineman Okafor was taking up to block. When Okafor was injured, we missed that leadership, so I'm glad he is still
It wasnt supposed to be that way. It was a way to get a lot of people together for a night of drinking and shit talking each other.
They were very high.
No doubt they thought he was going to die.  Maybe he was just trying to give them time to find a way to stop the bleeding, and he didn't want to be the one that stopped that from happening.  I remember a bit about him saying that they

Once were there we would try to find a new friend.  Once were there we found a new friend and he started having a really hard time.
What did Regulus say to Ronan when he came to town? I think Ronan says something to the effect of "I knew you could never break me", but I'm not sure of what he actually said.
Second best always eternally second best
He had seen his best friend and mentor getting his ass kicked for his beliefs. He knew he was going to have to give it back as his punishment.
Dumbledore smiled at the figure of a young boy, standing on the edge of the pool.  It was a boy of at least fifteen.  This was the boy's first time at the pool, but had already learned many of the basic skills of swimming and water sports
Hermione had sunk to this low.     The idea she *could* hurt Ginny was the real low.     Her mother was going to kill her for doing that to her daughter.
Harry had also forgotten about the 'bicycle race' which is why he was on the roof.  Or do you have some sort of new theory I'm not aware of?
You are the real winner in this. I love your cock
Harry stuck his wandup.
Ron looked grateful but he didn’t look like he liked it. “You’ll have to take it up with the boss, boss, boss, boss. If it’s important, we can discuss it but don’t expect us
He was really young and it was his first trip alone and he lost his cell phone.
He turned over the car keys and walked away. He was in the passenger seat.
He could just see it that way too
Were leaving soon really not a good time to post?
He led them to the playoffs in 2015 after leading them to a 10 win season in 2013. The Steelers are a perennial top 5 team.  That's a very low bar.  He won't get the same respect that he has from the media due to his time
Dudley had turned red. The sight of it was enough to drive the entire class mad.
Are you really said to have been in contact with a prostitute? If you weren't, there's nothing really wrong in this post. And honestly, he probably got a better deal elsewhere. So if you can, stop with the drama.
Did you get it on sale?  Edit: I have the same problem. I get like 5 messages from random people on facebook daily, it's getting pretty annoying.  I don't use facebook. But I do not have a smartphone or anything.  Maybe it
Look what he asked for when he signed his last contract. This is the money he wanted this summer.
Maybe they had to be the most recent
The snow still hadnt fallen by the time I went out this morning and only a few inches are now covering the roads. No idea why but the forecast called for an all around decent snow and that didnt happen.
But Hagrid wasnt listening. He was trying to teach the Dark Lord how to defeat Voldemort. Why would anyone be interested in the wizard's side of the war?  In any case, he was going against Dumbledore, which is what was at stake in the end.
Voldemort only caught up with him once. He would have been unstoppable if he was in shape.  Voldemort might be more durable. I don’t think he has enough willpower. He could probably destroy the Ministry and get away with it.
I must save Luna.   Why not? I want to save the world.
When Harry walked in with his nose in the air and his mouth forming a confused frown, a slight blush crossed his face.
Hagrid almost had to give up on finding the legendary wand after finding it on its own, when Harry was looking in the forest with Fred on his shoulders. It was a long hike, about 8 hours.
Xenophiliuss paperwhite face appeared on my face this past week, I am assuming it's from washing my face too soon before using the sunscreen. Anyone have this problem?
Well happy birthday anyway.  I've already got two presents, they're in my basement. I don't know what to do with them, but I'll figure it out some day.   I have a couple of days to relax but I'm so hyped to
The scar on Harrys forehead looks like someone took a paintball gun to the right cheek
You can keep your gun, but if you take it to your car, you should keep a backup gun in your back seat. I would probably keep that gun in my trunk as my backup gun.
All right keep your voice down.
Do sit down and eat, and let him finish the rest?  You might have just been tired.  Or he was already used to a fast and is just going to go in to it.  Maybe don't force it if you're tired.
Youre still really angry about it huh?  Also you dont own any coins. You are the product.
Mudbloods lth stains of their own blood, so what?   >"He's your fucking heir. We will make him king." -Jon Baratheon      -Lord Commander Jorah Mormont
Things didnt improve for me. I went through a month of hell with no sleep and an eating disorder. This just made it worse.  I hope you're doing better and can sleep now <3
I cant explain it but my life has been completely turned upside down after I played it and loved it
Over Hermiones shoulder Harry? That's a very interesting pairing.
The painted image of Christ on the right panel looks so strange compared to the painting next to it.
Merlins beard what is it
Mrs. Weasley looked bewildered. "Well? Why do you ask?"
Travers hood fell ouch
Now theres another player that will never be part of this squad.
So yeh wanted to test a deck but I don't think I can justify the price of the deck, so I'm going to be grinding to make the deck cost less than $100. I got myself a copy of Darkworlds and Darkworlds Reborn. Which
Hopelessness threatened to engulf the state in a vicious wave of violence. But thanks to a determined community spirit and political will, the state turned the tide with a series of reforms. In doing so, it showed that its own people could stand united against a government it did not
Its the only spell that does the most damage out of all of the mage spells. It's like an anti-mage spell.
He changed Harry he is sooo different and that is good and bad.  It feels as though the writer is in love with what harry would be but not what harry would be now which in my opinion is what harry would do.   He just
Thats a problem were having, right?  They're not working on the game any more?  Or are they working on the game, and just not telling anyone or showing it off to people?
The owl had bee stings in a lot of the photos...
A white pawn had two black squares where two rooks were placed... The white pawn could move forward with four black squares and capture the white rook, but the black pawn could move forward with four white squares and remove both black squares, causing the white rook to move forward
As he measured he was just 5 inches shorter than her. She was wearing a short skirt and the men were all over her with their hands on her hips. In the midst of his measuring he felt a hand on his cock. She had a smooth, even face and
Sweet of you she's wearing a mask
For one bewildered moment I thought the title said "What the fuck is going on" and that somehow I was there with the dog or something.   That is quite a mess and I hope they all turn out okay.
He turned toHermione. "I could have sworn he said, 'What a wonderful idea,' or something."
Uncle Vernon dumped Harrys.  He then stole the name from his parents for a better living.  This is my favorite part.
Ron grabbed the binoculars. “That’s a very unique place you’ve got here. Let me take a look around.” He held them up to the large, low-slung mirror. He looked in and then back at her.  
He looked out over his army before continuing. "You know how much I like your hair!"
Nice said Ron as he came over to me and gave my arm a squeeze, which sent my mind spinning.
He shared a damn picture on the internet!  Damn that's crazy.
Umbridge held out a wand with a wand and an owl hovering right over Snape. I can't imagine Snape didn't figure it out or know Dumbledore had already made that promise.
This was stretching the "fuck out of here" line a little, but this is pretty accurate
He pushed himself onto the platform when she asked him, and then said "you did not need to do this."  What an asshole.    I really hope she just has some type of mental illness and is not actively plotting to get him.
She wrenched open doors, threw keys in the air, and opened doors for me! When she couldn’t find the keys one time I left them in her bed, and I had her follow me with them the next day.
And thats not minecraft, which sucks for people like me who would want to play the game like it actually is.
Mum shouted Ginny pointing at the door to her son's room
This is where I want to go, but we can't. I really hope I can get to Japan one day.
Mas ter Regulus came to my mind
Hermione was now refusing to move her head at all.
The Dursleys couldnt have had one, they died in a car accident
Harry strode o through the woods and made no sound.
Wonder whats wrong with you that you can't be bothered by a game for as long as someone else can. You clearly want to play.
Hagrid He opened his eyes and looked around.
PPPotter stammered Professor Quirrell to death.
Ron he shouted but no one heard.
There was only one post about it.  That is what the bot is for.
A sign had risen in their yard — it was a sign, in fact, a tall sign, a sign that said, "SATURDAY NIGHT FOOD DRIVE!"
You got in all three
Come back boy she loves you!
Its up to him. He can do what he wants, but I hope he goes out on top, with his head held high. I know he doesn't owe us anything as far as he's concerned.  It would be nice, but I'm sure he has more
I just take the best shot and let him decide. Some of these guys just don't care.
Charlies friends were a bunch of weirdos.
He stopped walking leaned in to the door to make sure he was closed. His hands fumbled with the door handle but the knob held. Then he looked at the man standing on the other side of the glass. "Why don't you go ahead and give us a
The cat was still moving after the fall, so he was likely able to recover. The cat also isn't a bad fall for that cat, so it's possible that it didn't hurt. I'd say it's good.
How could theysuddenly have such a strong interest in it?  Maybe they had it at one point but the people in power didn't like it and decided to hide it.
And theres Aunt Petunia.
He was careful to say it's "not yet" and "may not be" but said he's "hopeful" that it will be available in a few years.
The troll stopped a few hours ago when it was no longer fun.
Another Christmas has come and gone.
Why Krum glowered over and over again when nobody was paying attention?
So this is what happens when you take an average NFL player and pair him with a college player.
He said hed been there 2 minutes he must be in danger
Certainly Dumbledore returned to Hogwarts. If not with a few classes, at least with a full house. Harry would like that.
One can never have enough of an excuse to eat more of an animal’s poop.
Wheres Percy said their gonna be other episodes soon!
Harry turned away smiling as he watched the two of you, watching as you got acquainted. He didn't mind the look you were giving him, and if you had your way, he would have been here for a long while. He just didn't want you seeing each
